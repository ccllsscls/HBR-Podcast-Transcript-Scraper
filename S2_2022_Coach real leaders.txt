MURIEL WILKINS: HBR Presents. I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Presents Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Sam to protect his confidentiality. He’s worked in finance at a major company where he’s been for over a decade. He’s a self-professed very natural finance guy.
SAM: My long-term goal is to be a CFO over the five- to 10-year period of time. And I knew in order to get there, I need to start from somewhere and make my way up from there. So, when I joined this business three, four years ago, I had update conversation with my manager that, “Hey, even though I’m joining for a different role, but the role which I’m doing now, that’s the kind of role which I always want to go.” So, the moment that opportunity came up, I immediately grabbed onto it. I had a good conversation with my manager. Of course, we went through the formal interview process with my current GM and with the HR, but I’m glad that everything fell in place and I was put on the board to lead this role.
MURIEL WILKINS: Sam has now been leading a team within the broader business for a few years, and he’s responsible for hitting major revenue targets. So far, managing his career progression has worked out relatively well, but now he’s starting to feel a bit stuck.
SAM: When I think of my roles and responsibilities, it was an upward move for sure, because I have more exposure and I’m delivering a number to the company. But in terms of my title, it was a lateral move. And I’ve been on that title for the last six, seven years now. And I’ve been pushing to get to the middle management, I would say, in the organization hierarchy. So, if I try to put myself right now, I am somewhere between the lower to middle of the middle management. I’m trying to push myself more into the middle or the upper middle management, more into the executive level, I would say.
MURIEL WILKINS: Sam is facing an issue that many in middle management face, where the opportunities to take on more responsibilities in your current role or through a lateral move are plentiful, but the upward path to a more senior role seems less clear. Let’s jump into the coaching session now, as I ask Sam how he’s tried to push himself to the next level and what he thinks is holding him back from getting there.
SAM: There could be many reasons. I mean, I’ve been pushing, Muriel, to get to the executive level. Even though I get excellent feedback all the time, but I feel like that’s not getting translated somehow into my upward move. Now, why it’s not getting translated, there could be one or two very specific skills, which somebody should have to get to the executive level, which probably I may not have, but I feel like I’m not getting those clear and direct feedback that, “Hey, Sam, you need to do X, Y, Z to get to the executive level.”

Episode 4: How Do I Move from a Specialist to a General Leadership Role?
Year: 2022

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Presents network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest, who we’ll call Krish to protect his confidentiality, is part of the finance team at a large global company. He recently got promoted to vice president and he’s proven to be pretty valuable at this company, running a team with dozens of people spread around the globe.
KRISH: Within the company that I’m working for, I support a very specific function of finance that supports the business on a day-to-day basis. It’s one of the critical thesis of the engagement with business, because it does define the performance of the business ultimately. It’s a high visibility role. I kind of lead the transformation of the organization along with the day to day execution of the function as well.
MURIEL WILKINS: But Krish is also struggling because he thinks he’s only being viewed as a subject matter expert, even though he feels he has a lot of other ways he can add value. In fact, a few years ago, he left the company looking for new opportunities that would allow him to spread his wings, but when the company faced certain challenges during COVID, they called for Krish’s specialized skills, and so he returned.
KRISH: And that essentially was when I got pulled back into the function to kind of really help take over the organization again, actually. I’ve been with this organization for twenty-plus years. Somewhere along the line, I really became, how do I say a very, very specialized person in the ecosystem of what this function supports.
MURIEL WILKINS: Now, Krish is wondering how to make it clear that while he’s valued for his area of expertise, he can also add value to the company in other ways, not just as a subject matter expert. Let’s jump into the conversation as I ask him about how he became so specialized in the first place.
KRISH: One, I think I like data. I’m a very curious person when you share data to me and because of the volumes and volumes of transactions that we typically engage with, given the size and scale that we engage with, I always got fascinated trying to make connections between data points. And that led me to understanding what you do here, what you do here. So, over the years, I’ve really built that understanding in a very, very holistic manner of the changes that can happen and what the impact of the changes are, and what are the kind of both financially, operationally, all of the elements of it, both internal, external. Pretty much I kind of became so, so specialized in this area that I not just created a name for myself, a legacy for myself, but I also built a huge network of people who I can always go to and say, “Can you kind of go look into this one?” And they would always do it because they have in some way or form seen me come to them in the past, either for a question or for an answer. They can absolutely feel comfortable coming to me if they have a question and I feel comfortable going to them if I had a question, even if the question was a very hard to… If it prompted an answer, which is not the answer which people wanted to hear. And so, that’s how I became so kind of really specialized in this one, in this specific function. And so, when things kind of got a little bit out of control, I got pulled back into this one and I essentially kind of moved away from that three years ago, like I said, and I walked back into the role in terms of supporting and making sure we can stabilize what was really happening in the ground actually. Transformation part of this comes in terms of the way it gets done today. But a lot of what I just said happens very manually. Big companies do have a lot of major processes. So, this is a process which is huge in how much pool of dollars that we manage, but very, very manual, extremely localized, very fragmented, very manual. And part of the reaction from the board of directors, from the executive leadership team is, “how could have we operated this way?” And people did not pay as much critical attention to it because everything was going okay. And when it broke the way it broke, everybody said, “How could we have really done it this way?” And that’s where the transformation opportunity came. And we committed investments to really kind of go address some of the fundamental aspects of how we manage, but we also kind of learned to be, vision to go further step up, to kind of really move to more like a machine language capabilities, artificial intelligence capabilities to help ourselves. That’s where the transmission. And so, when I came back, clearly, I didn’t want to do the same, what I did three years ago. So, the part of the kind of motivation for me to really look at it as an opportunity was the transformation opportunity.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, it sounds like you’ve sort of built your career or have built a reputation in this very specialized area that supports your business. It has led to creating a name for yourself within the company, as well as a network. And more recently, you were promoted into a role where you will continue to leverage that specialized knowledge and at the same time increase your scope by being responsible, but for other areas such as the transformation as well.
KRISH: Exactly right.
