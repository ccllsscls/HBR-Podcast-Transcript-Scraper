MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins. And this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Presents Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders, who’ve had a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them, so that hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting, focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Rebecca to maintain her confidentiality. She’s a C-suite level executive working in private equity backed companies and has over 20 years’ experience in corporate finance. She likes to fix things and she likes a challenge.
MURIEL WILKINS: Rebecca is facing a problem. Earlier in her career, she stayed at companies for long periods of time. But in the last few roles she’s had, she keeps wanting to leave. And something about that just doesn’t feel right to her.
REBECCA: The challenging things for me is when I’m tasked, I get to fix things. And I get in there and there’s all these sacred cows. What I typically do is I tend to then devolve into this, “I can’t fix this. I can’t fix this.” So, if nobody’s going to listen and I can’t fix it, then I got to move on to the next thing, and where’s my next job coming from. And then I go into another fix, and then I find myself in the same situation. So, I can’t really cope yet. I haven’t figured out how to lean into the discomfort.
MURIEL WILKINS: Rebecca, isn’t sure if she’s leaving too quickly, giving up or being a quitter, or if she just hasn’t found the right company and role yet.
REBECCA: What I would like to see is I would like to see myself able to see it through. I would like to be able to see through this role to a successful exit or a partnership, a company transaction, or a sale, and actually stick with it, not take my tequila shot and say, “I’m out of here.” But just to take my tequila shot and say, “Let’s start again tomorrow.”
MURIEL WILKINS: So, the question for Rebecca is, how do I see things through even when the going gets tough? Which made me curious about what her experience had been so far.

I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest who we’ll call “Celina” is a senior-level executive who is between jobs after negotiating a post-merger buyout from her last company. She’s in the midst of weighing different options for her next career move. And in the process she reflects on some of the challenges she faced in her previous leadership role.
CELINA: The role that I had was I was the executive vice president for external affairs and I called myself the executive in charge of relationships. I enjoyed being the person who built relationships for the organization internally and externally. And the challenge that I have is in doing that and in helping an organization be more proximate and helping people understand how to engage and talk and build bridges that it is somehow looked upon in a diminished, lower importance than some of the things that create revenue.
