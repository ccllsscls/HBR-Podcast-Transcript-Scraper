Episode 1: How Do I Address Feedback on Increasing My Visibility?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

Muriel Wilkins:
I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders, part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them, so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Jada to protect her confidentiality. She’s experienced positive career momentum in the past, frequently getting promotions and advancing through the ranks.
Jada:
I really learned out of that that I love people. My soft skills seem to be something that gets me into places and rooms. I was promoted pretty often and quickly in the beginning of those stages and got to learn even more about what I was good at, what I wasn’t good at, what I liked, what I didn’t like.
Muriel Wilkins:
While she was proud of her achievements, Jada also recognized that there were things about the industry she started her career in that she didn’t like as much, that weren’t really aligned with her values, and so she transitioned to the tech sector, where she could focus on strategy and big picture planning, among other things. But making that switch also came with some downsides.
Jada:
I knew that changing industries would potentially involve moving backwards to move forward. So, that has happened, and I was okay with that. I was a little disappointed that the growth that I saw previously in my old industry hasn’t been happening as quickly as it has been in this one, but generally, I’m loving the work. I find it extremely challenging. I love a challenge. I’m getting to a place now where it’s feeling a little less challenging and more comfortable, and I would like to get back into a space where I’m on my toes.
Muriel Wilkins:
Jada’s hoping to get back on the promotion track and managing teams. In order to do that, I started by asking a bit more about the slower career growth she’s experiencing and what she thinks might be behind it.
Jada:
I’ve asked for feedback about this from direct managers, from managers in other parts of the company who still see my work. And from my immediate managers, I get told that I need to work on my visibility. It’s really shocked me because we had a change in leadership, and I went to my new manager and asked them for some feedback on what I could be doing to grow, and they said visibility also. And I was like, “Wow, this is really interesting.” Because the old manager and the new manager never spoke to each other. I don’t think they had any notes they compared about me.
And what I couldn’t help thinking about was in my previous industry, the feedback that I often got there was around executive presence. Back then, I attributed the executive presence with being young, looking young, but now in my new industry, I’m usually one of the older people in the room. And it’s just really interesting to have seen across two different spaces how I’ve gotten feedback that’s related more to other people’s perception of me and not really about my performance and work.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, what do you make of that? You said it’s interesting that across two spaces, you’ve gotten feedback based on the perception of you rather than the actuality of your work. How does that land with you?
Jada:
So, I have two different thoughts on this, and I’m not sure where to land. One is it’s absolutely right, and I’m the problem, and I’ve got to figure out how to fix this thing and address it. But more recently, I’m doubting that the visibility is the real feedback that I need to hear. I believe I’m pretty active in my company. I am visible in my company; people see me. I’m very engaged. I’m in lots of different groups. One of the things recently that I’ve been trying to work on is a little more self-promoting, but I am very visible. So, I’m not sure if maybe I’m understanding visibility incorrectly, or is it that the managers are not giving me the real feedback that I need to hear.
Muriel Wilkins:
All right. And so, is that while you’re sitting here?
Jada:
It is.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, let me just make sure that I’ve heard you correct in terms of everything that’s happened. It sounds like in the past setting that you were, or organizations that you were, the promotions came fast and furious, and even though you did get feedback on your executive presence, you still were advanced. Fast forward, you’ve transitioned to a new space, a new sector, you feel like you’re doing the work, and you are being seen, or you’re out there, you’re active within the organization, and yet the promotions are not happening as quickly. And you feel like the feedback you’ve gotten from two data points are around your visibility.
Jada:
That’s correct.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, are you attributing the lack of promotion to this visibility aspect?
Jada:
Mostly, that’s all I know. If I’m going off of what I’m being told, that is the constant… I haven’t gotten any real feedback about any other areas of my work that seem to be holding me back. So, I don’t know that it’s anything else.
Muriel Wilkins:
Understood. And so, let me just… Because it’s important that we understand what is in your control and what is out of your control. And so, when you say the promotions are not happening as quickly, what are you comparing that to?
Jada:
I’m comparing it to other employees who joins the company when I did or even after who have less experience in certain avenues than I have.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, you are comparing it to internal candidates, not comparing it to how quickly you were getting promoted in a different sector or a different organization?
Jada:
Nope.
Muriel Wilkins:
That’s an important data point to understand to make sure that we’re looking at it within the context that you’re in. And then when they say visibility to you, how do you define what visibility is?
Jada:
For me, visibility was ensuring that when we have company-wide events, that I get an opportunity to present, or if we are in virtual sessions, that I am contributing in our sessions. We have other means of communicating, and I ensure that I am asking questions, I’m praising other people. I am telling stories from our customers. That to me was what visibility would be about.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, when you now think about you doing all those things and then getting feedback about you need to be more visible, have you thought about what else visibility might mean or what else it could incorporate?
Jada:
I did do some thinking on that. That’s where the idea of… I hate the word “Self-promoting,” but I thought that it was maybe important to ensure that the visibility that I have is showing not just me being out there, but how does the work that I do impact the company. And so, I’ve done a little bit more of filtering the visibility I have. I’m often known in our company as a culture person when there’s something fun to do, “Let’s tap her. She can get everybody to have fun and engaged.” And so, I’ve been saying no to some of those opportunities and ensuring that anything that I say yes to are places where I can say “I did this,” and the impact on the company was. That’s been a little more recent, but it is one thought I had on how I could do a little better with this visibility.
Muriel Wilkins:
Look, that that is a part of it. Because visibility for the sake of visibility is just showing up, as you put it, being out there. And it’s like, “Okay, but being out there for what?” And is the way that you’re out there relevant to those who ultimately need to be impacted by that visibility or who matter in terms of what your goal is, which is to advance. So, when you think about making your visibility matter, making it relevant, think about it in terms of…
Well, this is the thought that’s coming to mind. It’s like when you scroll through social media and you get ads and you’re like, “Why is this in my feed?” It’s visible, but it’s not relevant. And then you get the one that you’re like, “Oh yeah, how did they even know that I was thinking that? Were they listening to the conversation that I was having with my friend literally 10 minutes ago?” So relevant. And so, when you think about it that way, that’s the relevancy. And my question to you is, what would be the algorithm that you would need to have to be able to be relevant to those stakeholders?
Jada:
Our company obviously has a vision, a mission. We have our company goals. That maybe… Most recently, the visibility that I’ve been trying to do that was intentionally aligned with impact to the company has been a little more aligned to our mission and vision. And maybe I could do some more strategic intentional visibility work around company goals and ensuring that the people who can make the decisions of my promotions, of my growth, of my development, that my visibility is aligned with the things that are important to them, and maybe not what I assumed it to be.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, there’s this dissonance between potentially between what you assume is important and what is actually important. And I don’t know what is, because those stakeholders are not sitting here with us, and I don’t get a chance to speak to them in this situation, but do you have a sense of what’s important to them? What keeps them up at night?
Jada:
Yes, I have unique insight into that because I’m an extrovert at work, and I have no problem just scheduling a meeting with someone and talking to them about, “So, tell me what keeps you up at night?” And I have a lot of insight from our directors and MVPs on what is a priority to them, particularly, and not just for their team or what’s being spoken to the company. So, I do know we have some product changes that are going on, and I know making sure those get rolled out smoothly is top of mind for them. A few things like that.
Muriel Wilkins:
It would be critical to figure out what is on their critical path to ensure that you are on that path. The question is… Again, you’re visible. You’re visible on a particular path, but is that the critical path? And that’s part of what you have to find out, and what you have at your disposal is you said, it sounds like you have the wherewithal to go and talk to folks and ask the questions. It’s more a matter of what are the questions that you should be asking. And so, in this case, if you were to sit down with, and we’ll talk about the stakeholders soon, but if you were to sit down with some of these folks, what would be the questions that you would ask that you haven’t yet asked that would give you more clarity around how you make your visibility relevant?
Jada:
So, it’s funny that you ask the question about, “What keeps you up at night?” Because that is one of the questions I often ask them, but maybe recently I was reading about prioritizing time and resources and I was fumbling around with the question of “If you could devote 10% more of your resources, whether that’s time, personnel, budget, to another project that’s going on, what would that project be?”
I am very curious to know where would they love to spend more time and more resources that aren’t getting that that might be something that bubbles up into what is a priority for them. I don’t think asking them about where they’re spending their time now necessarily gives me insight into their priorities because I think whatever’s on fire is usually getting more of your time than what a priority might be.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, in terms of what questions to ask, you can be at the macro level, which is “What keeps you up at night?” And then there are more granular zooming in micro questions, which are these project-oriented, what… Very tactical, “What saves you time?” Et cetera. And there’s probably a whole range in between, but what is clear is that even in asking them, you want to frame it in a way where you can walk away with understanding what has the most weight, what is most important, what is causing the most heartburn, so that if there is an opportunity for you to focus and contribute to relieving that heartburn, then that makes it relevant.
Jada:
I like that.
Muriel Wilkins:
Either relieving the heartburn because you’re problem-solving and taking it away, or you’re being opportunistic and you’re creating value in a way that then relieves whatever the challenges are, if that makes sense.
Jada:
It does. I do think I could take advantage better of my time in these chats with other people by asking better questions. More of my intention with those meetings previously had been for people to see me, for me to get an opportunity to talk about what I was doing, build relationships, but investing a little bit more into those other people, and asking the good questions will be really helpful.
Muriel Wilkins:
While it might feel like semantics, being clear about what we mean is really useful when working through a challenge. In Jada’s case, she used the word visibility and was struggling to understand what her managers meant by it, but I wasn’t quite sure how she defined it for herself either. And using my own definition wouldn’t be helpful. I have to meet her where she is. When you think of a term like visibility, it can mean different things to different people. For some it can simply mean speaking in meetings and joining groups at the organization, or you can expand your definition of visibility to being seen as doing what leadership and the company views as most valuable in the current context.
As in Jada’s case, sometimes there’s a mismatch between what you may be doing, how you’re defining success, and how others might be defining it. Getting specific about what those differences are is really useful before moving to problem-solving. It’s a good sign that Jada is already taking the initiative and trying to have conversations with leaders at her organization. So, the question is whether she’s leveraging those conversations to better inform her as to what leaders are really looking for. Those conversations need to be focused. And so, I wanted to zero in on how relevant she’s positioning herself in those discussions. Let’s jump back in as she explains what her approach has been in these discussions, what she’s been talking about, and with who?
Jada:
I have been aiming for people that are outside of our department, just some cross teams that I don’t always have the need to work with very often. I fought at the time that being a mile wide versus an inch deep was a smarter strategy, but now, talking to you, I’m questioning that maybe I should be spending more time with the people in my team versus other departments who have less to do with my growth and development. Those are probably people who would be advocates or sponsors. And while it is helpful to talk to them, I don’t know that it’s immediately helping me with this issue.
Muriel Wilkins:
All right. So, that’s a great distinction. It’s like, how deep do you go? If you think about it as a T model, there’s the vertical, which is “I’m going to have deep visibility internally in my world, on my team, in my group, in my division.” And then the top part of the T, the horizontal part, is “I’m going to go broad across the organization so that people know me.” And there are clearly benefits to both. And so, part of what you’re saying is you’ve been focused more on the horizontal in terms of the breadth. And has that come… Let me just ask you for clarity for me, has that come at the expense of the depth within your group, the vertical within your group?
Jada:
100%, yes.
Muriel Wilkins:
And has it come at an expense vertically, downward? Meaning people more junior than you, or people more senior than you, or both?
Jada:
I would say I’m generally more senior.
Muriel Wilkins:
You have done more senior?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
Got it. So, in what way has it been at the expense of downstream vertically within your team?
Jada:
Vertically, downward. People see what I’m doing broadly, and that has probably been why I’ve gained more of a reputation for being the strong culture person. They see me bringing together people from across teams versus maybe being more strategically minded, working on our internal projects. I do some of that work, but I don’t know that people see me as the expert on those things. And so, that’s how it has taken me away from that type of visibility.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, there’s a part of you’re known. You’re known as a culture carrier, you’re known as a good person. I’m just going to label it as that, and I’m just going to push it. You react to what I’m saying. Do you imagine that there’s a question around, “But what does she really do?” or “What does she really deliver?”
Jada:
There’s the potential for that being true.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, part of it is as you’re building your story and your narrative and giving it this visibility piece to it, there is… Of course, you want to be known, but then there’s “What do you want to be known for?” And I haven’t quite heard from you. It sounds like you’re known as the culture carrier, but what I haven’t heard is, is that what you want to be known for? And does the person who’s known primarily as the culture carrier within your organization, is that the currency that gets them advanced?
Jada:
It is not the currency that gets them advanced. I do enjoy some of that culture work, but at the end of the day, I know for promotions and advancements that unless there’s a culture problem, that is not going to be anything that’s particularly helpful for me.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, what do you want to be known for? What do you want to be known for? And then what do you think you need to be known for to be advanced? Which are two different questions.
Jada:
I’m going to start with what I think I need to be known for, which is being a strategic thinker, adding value and impact to the company, which is going to… At the end of the day be, “How do I make the company more money?” What I want to be known for? I want to be known for being a great team player, someone who is easy to work with, who’s a great brainstormer, who brings innovative ideas, who works well with others, really, at the end of the day.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, what would it look like for you to be known for both?
Jada:
That’s a great question. It would have to do with working on projects with people from within my division and maybe leading those projects from time to time, but really being a great collaborative person on those and making sure that the projects are the strategic ones. And we do a lot of project work internally, and many times those can be things that you’re working on individually, and maybe me looking for more opportunities for the projects that involve working on a team.
Muriel Wilkins:
All right. And so, when you think about that as the potential path to get you more visibility in a way that’s relevant, that you are working collaboratively on projects that have that strong strategic element to them, what is the difference between doing that and what you are currently or have been doing?
Jada:
I would say I’ve done some group team project work. It has not been considered the type of things that are strategic that are impactful business-wise for the company. The work that I would have to do to get on those types of projects is let people know I’m looking for that. Sometimes those projects exist, and people get assigned to do those types of things because the director needs this done and puts together a group of people. It’s not necessarily asked widely, “Hey, we have this project, who wants to volunteer?” And it seems like maybe the broad work that I have been doing is more of “Who wants to volunteer to do this?” And I need to be one of those people who get picked to work on these.
Muriel Wilkins:
Who gets selected?
Jada:
Mm-hmm.
Muriel Wilkins:
All right. So, if the visibility that you need to attain, if we were to measure it, come back a year from now and say, “One of the measures of success for this visibility is that you are now selected for some of these projects.” What would you need to be doing differently in terms of your visibility? Because again, you are doing things to be visible. I just don’t think it’s getting you what you want. So, how would your visibility need to look and feel different in order for us to be able to visibly see an uptick in you being selected or increase the probability of you being selected for these types of projects?
Jada:
So, right away, I’m thinking I can continue to have those meetings with senior people in the company, but I need to maybe focus those on the people within my division. When I ask better questions during this time with them, yes, the question should be figuring out what their priorities are, but also considering how can this be something that I’m working on? Even asking them, “Have you thought of putting together a group to work on this thing? I would love to be a part of that.” I have to let them know I can’t expect them to read my mind and just put me on projects. The first and foremost thing is letting them know this is the type of thing I want to be doing.
Muriel Wilkins:
That’s right. So, A, you’ve got to let them know why you’re even there. Why are you visible in front of them? What is it that you want? And so, that’s making the ask and making it clear what it is that you’re hoping for. The second is, would it be clear to them what value you would be bringing by them bringing you on one of these projects?
Jada:
No, I don’t think that it is always clear, especially when I’m talking to people who don’t directly manage me, so they don’t see what my strengths are in my work. They don’t know my work at all sometimes, so I can’t expect them to know what value I would bring.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, when we don’t know the value that we’re bringing and we’re not articulating it, what it feels like in those conversations, even when we’re making an ask, is, “Oh, here’s what you manager…” Let’s say, “Leader can offer me.” But we’re not really responding to what do I have to offer, even if not asked, “What do I have to offer the manager?” And particularly, in an element like what you described, which is it’s a staffing issue. You want to be picked. Well, what are they picking you for? You pick something because you believe it has something to offer you.
And when you think about some of these folks that you have to deal with, what is important to them? Think about being in their shoes when they have to select somebody to work on these strategic projects. If you were in their shoes, what would those individuals need to be able to offer and bring to the table to make them pickable?
Jada:
I’m really interested in actually finding that out, maybe in these chats moving forward. I’m curious to know if our leadership puts together teams based on product knowledge or are they also looking for someone who works well with others, which was important to me, but if that’s not what they need for their teams, then I will need to sell the value of having me on the team a little differently.
Muriel Wilkins:
And part of what you might want to explore, Jada, is not necessarily that it’s mutually exclusive, right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
Because I’m hearing you say, “If what they don’t want is the collaboration and the getting along with other people and working well with them…” Which are all the things that you have as strengths, “Then maybe I’ve been off all along.” And what I’m suggesting is it’s not that those things are not valued, is are they the things that actually get you in the door. Think about going to a concert. “I’m going to go to the Beyoncé concert in a few weeks.” So, it’s top of mind. What gets me in the door is the ticket. And then once I’m there, I can offer all the other… Well, offer… I don’t know if I’m there to offer, but I can do all the other things. I can dance and sing and have a good time, but if I don’t have a ticket to get in, I’m not going to be inside that concert. I’ll be watching the videos on Instagram.
So, what is the ticket of entry? What is… For me, the ticket to entry is its actual cash currency. And that’s why I keep coming down to “Okay, what’s the currency that you bring?” Is it, “I need somebody who can really deliver, somebody who I don’t have to worry about them doing the work?” Is it the expertise, as you put it? Is it… What is that actual ticket to entry that makes one more prone to being selected in these types of projects versus not? And I think that’s the part that you have to hone in on.
Jada:
I agree with you, and I may have made some assumptions early on about what that ticket was, and I have not asked directly to anyone about what that ticket is.
Muriel Wilkins:
What’s the assumption that you made?
Jada:
Some of those things that I want to be known for, like being a great team player, and getting along with others, and being good at brainstorming and supporting people, were what the leaders wanted in creating these teams. And maybe there was even a little assumption that the leadership thought I knew what the ticket was, and I might need to get some clarity on that.
Muriel Wilkins:
And it might be that all of those things they actually do want, it’s just not what is most important. And as much as I’m not a believer in, or I don’t encourage people to say, “Oh, well, look at what everybody else is doing, what are they doing?” And do the same thing. I would never say that. That said, there is something to be learned by others’ experiences, not so much around, “Oh, I need to be doing exactly what they’re doing.” But to give you a sense of, “Well, what am I seeing? What’s the hypothesis around what the currency is here?” So, that then I can make an informed decision as to whether that’s the type of currency that I want to be involved in? You know what I’m saying?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
I just had to send some graduation gifts to my kid’s friends, and I reached out and I said, “Okay, I want to send you a gift.” “What is it?” Someone said, “Cash App.” “I don’t do Cash App.” You got to choose a different currency, right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
If you want the gift, if you don’t, then… So, it’s not a right or wrong, but you then make an informed decision. So, I say all that to say, when you look, you mention that there are other people in your organization who joined at the same time or later than you, who tend to not necessarily just get promoted, because now we’ve peeled the onion back, get selected for these types of projects that provide them with the visibility to then position them to get promoted, increase the probability of being promoted. What is it that you’re seeing as their currency, if anything, at this point, that you believe is different than what you lead with in terms of currency?
Jada:
So, one of the things off the top of my head that they often have in common are being very detail-oriented, great eye for the small things, for gaps in processes, for a what-if scenario that nobody had thought of. They’re really great at those very detailed things, where I tend to be much more big picture. They’re also extremely organized and pretty organized. I don’t think that’s a big deal. They work well independently, very consistent with their work, and great product knowledge also.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, I want you to imagine for a minute, it’s five years from now. Not even five years, so let’s be a little more aggressive. Three years from now, and you are running one of these projects. You have gotten promoted, you’re now the person selecting, you’re staffing these projects, you’re picking who’s going to be on. And the people that you’re picking are exactly as you’ve described: detail-oriented, they can run through the what-ifs, they have strong expertise, they’re organized. What would make you pick those individuals? Who are leading with that? And who, by the way, can also work well with other people, but they’re leading with this other stuff. Majoring in that, minoring on the collaboration versus the person who’s majoring in the collaboration, minoring on all the things that you just listed? What would be your rationale for picking one versus the other?
Jada:
I would go with the detail-oriented people for my team, because I know the work is going to get done.
Muriel Wilkins:
You got it. So, you just figured out what is relevant. You just figured out what is relevant. The price of admission is giving the sense for getting on these projects and these assignments, that they have full confidence that you’re going to get the job done. And what I wonder… I have no idea, Jada. I don’t get the sense that you can’t do the job. The sense that I get right now is… Or I’m curious about, is you haven’t been leading with that as your brand. And so, while the culture carrier piece is really great and helpful, it’s not necessarily what’s going to make the manager or leader, whoever’s leading these projects, at 1:00 in the morning, go to sleep because they know the job’s getting done.
It reminds me, when I was in consulting, a newly minted consultant fresh out of business school a long time ago, one of the partners sat me down and said, “You know, one day you’re going to make a great partner, because you’re so good at building relationships with the clients, and you’re really good at seeing the big picture and thinking strategically, and speaking on your feet.” And I got so… I was like, “Oh my gosh, I’m going to get promoted early, right?” And then he said, “But for now, what I need you to do is be able to crank through a spreadsheet and pull together a PowerPoint deck,” Because that was the currency for where I was.
And what he was basically saying is, “Those things are great, don’t lose them, but they’re not what make you relevant right now for where you are in your career, in terms of what I need in terms of leading this client engagement. If you can get those things done, it will open up the opportunities for you to be able to do all this other big stuff that you want to do. So, don’t lose it, but you got to be able to get past the initial entry points.”
Jada:
So, it feels like part of the brands that I need to be building is how do I ensure that people see me, not just as the culture person, but as reliable, as consistent, and my visibility needs to be about how I was reliable, how I was consistent, how I pulled through and got the project done is feeling very right as I’m saying it.
Muriel Wilkins:
In this conversation, Jada has now reached a point where she can start to differentiate between what she had assumed was important to leadership at her organization and what stakeholders might actually be looking for. Some of that will be informed by future conversations, but simply understanding the current mismatch is a step forward for Jada in her career. To get on a different track, Jada needs to focus her energy in the right places. First, by understanding the currency of the organization, and then developing a plan to gain more of that currency to advance her career.
One way to effectively do that is to not just have conversations, but to really put yourself in the shoes of those you’re looking to for opportunity and figure out what their needs are and what they’re looking for. Let’s dive back in as we start to refine what Jada should be demonstrating, if she wants to truly address the feedback that she needs to be more visible. When you think about leadership, there’s two aspects of it. There’s the… I’m going to keep it very crass… But there’s the task orientation, the getting stuff done, getting results. And there’s the relational orientation, which is all about the people, and collaboration, and working well with others, et cetera. The sweet spot is being able to do both.
And there are times when you may need to lead more with one versus the other, because you’ve been leading so much with one versus the other. It needs to be balanced out. One can’t come at the sacrifice of the other. And again, I don’t know the culture of your organization, but based on what you’ve shared, it sounds to me like what’s valued, at least as priority number one, is the task orientation, and then the relational piece is the icing on the cake.
Jada:
I would agree with that, yes.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, you just can’t be icing.
Jada:
Wow, we went from visibility to…
Muriel Wilkins:
Icing. And let me just say, some people just like icing and no cake. So, part of your question also needs to be, “At some point, maybe I need to be in an environment where it is all about the icing. And the cake is just a little bit of cake.”
Jada:
I’ve thought about that from time to time. If the work that I do is my strengths, the things that I enjoy doing the most. Is my job currently now allowing me to lean into those things?
Muriel Wilkins:
Well, look, you work long enough. You’re going to have situations where you can use your strengths 100% of the time, and then it’s like, “Ugh, I’m not using them enough.” The key is you don’t want your weaknesses to overshadow your strengths, right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
That’s what you hear a lot of people say, “Don’t let your weaknesses overshadow your strengths.” Yes, and you don’t want to focus so much on your strengths that it’s neglecting some other aspects that are necessary for the work, or in your case, for advancement. The question is, are you able to use your strengths enough that it satisfies you? That it gives you that sense of fulfillment, and reflects the strengths that you have? Does that need to be 100% of the time?
Jada:
No. Definitely not. And I do feel most days that the work that I’m doing allows me to lean into my strengths, and at the end of the day, I like my job. I don’t get the Sunday scaries at all or anything like that. I feel adequately challenged. But I need to grow in this area in order to get where I want to go.
Muriel Wilkins:
And going back to your original question, it’s making sure that your visibility reflects that you have these different facets to offer, not just this one aspect of who you are.
Jada:
I can do that.
Muriel Wilkins:
You can do that?
Jada:
Mm-hmm.
Muriel Wilkins:
All right. So, tell me what your assignment is?
Jada:
A few things. Not in any particular order, but number one, ensure that the meetings that I have with more senior people in the company are maybe a little more focused to my division. Number two, start asking better questions about the things that they’re prioritizing. Number three, let them know that I want to work on projects and ensure that I communicate what value I can add to those projects, and also ensure that the visibility that I am putting out there is focused on how I’m reliable, how I get things done, and look for ways where I can potentially bring some of that culture into the strategic work that we’re doing. I don’t think I need to abandon that part of me completely, but they can work together.
Muriel Wilkins:
I don’t think you need to abandon it at all. This is additive. I don’t think it’s subtractive. You’re growing the pie in terms of the value that you bring, rather than it being a zero-sum game. It’s one or the other, or it diminishes what you bring. And so, what do you think would get in the way of you being able to fulfill your assignment?
Jada:
Being scared. Being scared of being out of my comfort zone. I need to maybe spend some time thinking about the places where I have been consistent and reliable and got things done, so that when I present what value I can bring to the projects, I have things that I can name specifically. And those two things most immediately, and then also just making sure that I get to ask those better questions. I need to practice that.
So, that I don’t… A word that I kept saying in the beginning of this was that I was making a lot of assumptions. And I want to make sure that when I have these conversations with our senior leadership about their priorities, that they’re very clear about what those priorities are, and I don’t make assumptions about what they are, just so that I can ensure that I am aligned with what they’re thinking.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, how do you think you could do that? Give me an example of a question you would ask where you are making assumptions versus one where you are either not, or clarifying, or trying to really understand.
Jada:
Well, about something you asked me earlier in our conversation, you repeated back to me the scenario and asked me if that was accurate doing that with them. So, what I heard you say was… And let them tell me “No, that was wrong,” or “Yes, you heard that correctly.” Is one way to get things clarified.
Muriel Wilkins:
You just said it. It’s how you frame it, and framing it in an open way where it’s like, “Hey, this is exactly what you said, what I’m hearing, but just clarify for me. I’m kicking the tire. Is this what you’re thinking?” With an openness that it might be different than what you had originally thought. One of the things, Jada, I also want to make sure that we talk about a little bit is we’ve been talking or discussing a lot about what you can do to provide yourself with visibility. In what ways are you leveraging others to give you visibility? Let’s assume you do all the things that we just talked about, right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
And so, your visibility is targeted and focused in the right way in terms of the message that it sends. Are you the sole voice, or what other voices do you have?
Jada:
I would say that there are definitely people in the company who come to me and they’re like, “You haven’t been promoted yet?” And they do their part to try to give me praise in certain places. Or I’ll hear from my manager like, “Oh, I was in a conversation the other day and I heard your name brought up about blah, blah, blah,” Which is lovely, but those people may not always be speaking about me or giving me visibility in the right channels. I don’t want to come off as desperate, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with saying to someone, “Hey, I would love for you to tell so-and-so about this project when you have time.” It’s okay to ask.
Muriel Wilkins:
That’s not desperate. That’s sponsorship.
Jada:
Good point.
Muriel Wilkins:
Right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
That is exactly what sponsorship is. You’re asking or attaining somebody who’s willing to be an advocate on your behalf. And what most people fail to recognize is what they want is somebody who advocates when it’s time for promotions. And I don’t know, I always think the advocacy needs to start way before that. Get them to advocate on your behalf on smaller things, like “Oh, could you introduce me to this person? Could you see if I could get on that project? Could you call that manager? I’m going to speak to them. But could you also give them a call and see if they could get me on?” So, those are the smaller milestones that then can build up to the bigger one of, “Hey, when it’s promotion time, could you speak on my behalf?”
And so, the first place is to identify who those folks are, and primarily it’s who’s within your circle already, who might already be mentoring you, perhaps, but now they are people who could sponsor you. And the difference is, they’re not just saying, “Oh, I hear you didn’t get that project. Oh, why not?” They’re saying, “You didn’t get that project? Let’s figure out how to get you on that project next time.”
Jada:
I have sponsors in the company, but the problem is they are not within our division where I need to be seen, and I could do a better job of finding those people there.
Muriel Wilkins:
Because sponsors, just for the sake of sponsors, doesn’t matter. It’s just like your visibility. They also need to have weight and relevance for what you’re doing. If I am a musician, but my sponsor is somebody who’s a sponsor in the athletic world, nice, but not really relevant, right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
So, you want to make sure that you have individuals who are sponsors who have weight within the context, or where it matters for you. Doesn’t mean you get rid of the others. You need a diversified portfolio of sponsors, and you also need to make sure that you have some that are addressing the needs that you have now. And similarly, just like we talked about with your managers, they’re going to want to know what value… What are they getting out of sponsoring you?
Jada:
Good point. At the beginning of this conversation, I thought we were really going to go into a place where visibility was inaccurate feedback, and I’m still not entirely sure that my previous managers meant visibility to the depth that we had a discussion about it today. But I am happy to hear that there’s some value that I can take from that, when I didn’t really believe it in the beginning.
Muriel Wilkins:
There you go with your little assumptions that might get in the way of being able to then say, “Okay, well, what do I make out of this?” Right?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
And look, it may be that what we talked about is not it. What we do know is that it’s different than the path you are on, and so it’s worth testing out as a hypothesis and going out there and seeing if it helps in terms of the visibility. And one of the things I would encourage you to do: those managers who told you, “You need to work on your visibility.”
You may want to go back to them and say, “Hey, I heard you. I heard your feedback. Here’s what I’m planning on doing. Here’s what I’m understanding where I need to increase my visibility. Here are the areas where I’m already visible. Here’s where I’m not, and where I’m not in this way, what do you make of that? Do you have anything else to add?” So, have them provide input on this path that you’re now going to bear out, because they might be able to get more explicit and more detailed around what they actually mean.
Jada:
I agree with that. And I don’t think it’s awful to maybe ask them for help in getting on those projects and helping to get that visibility strategically that I need.
Muriel Wilkins:
Absolutely. So, how do you feel now versus when we first got started?
Jada:
Oh my gosh, lighter. I feel like I have clarity. I feel like I have work to do. I feel like I have a plan. I feel motivated also.
Muriel Wilkins:
Good. Look, we all have work to do, but we don’t all get motivated, so I’m glad to hear that you are motivated because that’s what will move that plan into action. Okay?
Jada:
Yeah.
Muriel Wilkins:
If anything, the worst-case scenario is you find out, “Nope, that’s not what visibility is.” And then it’s like, “Okay, what’s the next path?” But there’s some untested territory that would be worth your while to explore.
Jada:
I agree. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just ask you, “What do we do next?”
Muriel Wilkins:
Exactly. Exactly. Blame it on the coach. Well, listen, Jada, thank you. Thank you so much.
Jada:
Thank you.
Muriel Wilkins:
No matter where you are in your career, even up to the C-suite, visibility is important, and part of the key is understanding what visibility really means in your organization, to your leaders, even to your board, and adjusting your tactics to align with that definition. There are a few questions you can ask yourself to get you started. First, what kind of leadership qualities seem most in demand at your organization? Next, how much of those values line up with your skills and experience so far? Finally, are you presenting yourself as having those skills and thereby showing how you add value? It’s all about making sure you are visible and relevant for the context that you’re in. That’s it for this episode of Coaching Real Leaders. Next time…
Speaker 3:
I feel like I’m at this point that I am in a very good position to really continue to be intentional, to build my long-term plan in the company I’m at. I’m about to have career growth conversations where I am, and I really want to pause and think of, “Okay, what does that look like for me?”

Episode 1: How Do I Get Recognized as a Leader?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I am Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Denise to protect her confidentiality. She spent much of her career in project-oriented roles and a few years ago made the move to an organization where she’s increasingly gaining more leadership responsibility.
DENISE: In the past year, I’ve had a lot of growth opportunities. I came in as an individual contributor, but especially in the past year, I’ve been given more leadership responsibilities and management and being able to showcase the work that we do to our executive teams, our board, our stakeholders. I’m still an individual contributor on the org chart, but unofficially I’ve been given more management, the kind of visionary leadership responsibilities, and the communication being that face and that creator to guide the direction of my team and gotten really great feedback from that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Denise feels like she’s on the way up the ladder, but there’s a bit of a catch: the culture of her organization.
DENISE: I’ve come to see and be outright told that to be seen as a leader here, you need to be personally close to top leadership, preferably with decades of personal relationships with them, which I do not have. This history of hiring and promoting friends based on personal relationships has evolved somewhat, but it’s still how do I thrive as an outsider in a more insular insider environment where relationships are often valued higher than experience or technical skill sets?
MURIEL WILKINS: So much about career advancement is not just about being able to do the job, but also building the right relationships—a ceiling that Denise is bumping right up against. So, to start the coaching session, we zeroed in on what she means by thrive. How is she defining growth in her career as it stands today?
DENISE: I think to be recognized for leadership responsibilities and work that I do, I think in an environment where leaders are often chosen years and years in advance to come in and to be doing the work often feels like it’s an uphill battle of, I’m an outsider and an insider environment. I do question, am I reading too much into this or just being more aware of the senses of equity and belonging? Am I not being seen as a leader because I’ve only been here for a short time compared to those around me? I’m trying to figure out how I can be seen more as a leader for the work that I’m putting in and showing up to do.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I hear two questions there. One is why am I not being seen as a leader? And then the second question being, how do I get seen as a leader?
DENISE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, let me ask you, what do you think the commonality is between those two questions?
DENISE: I think maybe the sense that I’m like, “Oh, I’m not being seen as a leader,” and starting from there and how can I work on that? How can I build on that skill set?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. So there’s a assumption that I’m picking up that you’re not seen as a leader. The only way those two questions are valid is if indeed you’re not seen as a leader. And so, I would like to understand where is that assumption coming from? What evidence do you have of that assumption?
DENISE: Hearing it conversationally that another person was chosen as the next leader, let’s say, of a team that I’m working with or my team years ago, even before I got there. So hearing the comments like that and just seeing how people grow and move in the company. I am making assumptions, but it does seem that I’ve seen some of the inequities of how people are given opportunities in the company, and it seems like a lot of it is based on some personal relationships.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And by no way am I by raising this assumption saying it doesn’t mean it’s not true. I’m just saying let’s make sure the assumption is right because it’s what we’re operating on. It’s just like if I put in the wrong assumption into a budget model, I’m going to get very different results than if I put in a different assumption. So you are basing it on what you’ve seen in terms of who has been chosen for particular roles. Is that right?
DENISE: That’s a part of it. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s a part of it. So tell me what the other parts of it are.
DENISE: I think it’s what started as a smaller organization over the past several decades has seen growth and has matured to a part where some of the founding members are retiring or moving on to other things. I think where I’m at is in this organization that’s at this transitional moment of hiring more people and bringing in more folks like myself that are maybe more outsider. I say in quotes. But I think it’s at this moment of not just being such an insular organization. So I feel fortunate and committed and really passionate about the team that I’m on and the organization that I’m in and the role that I’m in. I really want to work on coming in from a technical contributor and how can I build on some of the communication and some of the other skill sets to round out that leadership potential to hopefully be seen as that. But when do you be patient with those kind of things and when do you put yourself out there a little bit more? Or you said what does growth and thriving mean? I think it’s just kind of being valued and seen and recognized for the kind of leadership work that I’m doing, but not formally recognized for at the moment.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So help me understand because I do think it’s important that we have a measure of success here. So, if a year from now I were to talk to you and I say, “Hey, do you feel recognized now?” And your answer was an enthusiastic, “Yes, I do.” What would need to be true for that to be true?
DENISE: Maybe moving into more of an official or changing the description of my role or the scope of responsibilities to accurate reflect some of the additional opportunities and leadership responsibilities that I’ve been doing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So for your role, the scope of the role to reflect what you’ve been doing. I just want you to put it all out there. You’re just talking to me. I have no bearing on all this. Is it also title? Is it compensation? Is it a promotion or is it really just look, I just want the scope of the role to match what I’m doing? It’s like my kids put together their holiday list. I tell them be specific or else I’m just going to go with what I think is right. So I want you to be specific. What would be your wish list here?
DENISE: Definitely I think it’s important that title and compensation matches the scope of the job so that you feel valued for the level of work that you’re putting in. So I think that’s a part of it, but it’s really, I think about the role and being recognized on my team. I think I’m already being recognized with executive leadership and being able to seen as a leader in my department, but I think just a more formal recognition of that. So job description. title is less important to me, but.
MURIEL WILKINS: I want to go back a little bit to what you shared before, which is the question is how can I be seen as a leader? But then when I asked you for evidence, you talked about who’s been chosen. And so is the question, is it about you being seen or is it about you being chosen because those are two different things?
DENISE: That’s a good point. And sometimes I feel like seeing when years in advance people have been chosen, I feel like, well, I should have gotten in line 20 years ago. It just highlights what I can be seen as a weakness that I’m fairly new in an organization that really values tenure and longevity. That that seems like something that’s not something I can automatically build on. I can’t go back in time and be here 20 years ago. So from this moment going forward, what can I do? I guess to be seen I think more. Certainly I want to be able to showcase the work that my team does and steer that vision and I feel like I’m showing up for that work and leading on those responsibilities. And so just to be able to be seen for that work.
MURIEL WILKINS: What has led you to be invited at the table, to take on the increased responsibilities, to interface with the board to get on the balcony as you stated before? What has led to being invited to do that if you had not been seen?
DENISE: I’m not sure. I show up and dig into the work using technical skills and building trust with my team, and I think having some of that vision of being able to take company direction and priorities and goals and be able to filter it down to lead the team with, okay, what are our pathways? What are our processes? What are our plans to map out our team wide goals? And then be able to communicate that upward and outward of being a face and that voice of the team. I think because I’m able to speak to some of the more technical side of as we’re embracing more systems that I think originally it was like, well, I can speak to the system so I can be that voice of advocating and showing the future vision of how we’re going to use them.
And then I think that translated into, I got really good feedback of like, “Oh wow, you’re really good at communicating and putting together a vision and a deck and collaborating with everyone and on the team and workshopping of those presentation skills.” And that’s something that I’ve wanted to work on too of knowing that of leaders and managers that I’ve respected in the past, really great communicators. So I took that opportunity to work on maybe a part of my working experience that I hadn’t had as much experience in. And I think that just snowballed into being able to communicate that vision that’s spread to other responsibilities within the team and being able to communicate that outward as well.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so how did that happen without you being seen though? It’s like if I said they didn’t see me, so they didn’t invite me to the dinner party, and yet I’m here at the dinner party and I did get the invitation. How was I not seen?
DENISE: I think I just showed up to the dinner party.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you invited yourself to do all those things? Nobody asked you to do them?
DENISE: No. I think I put myself forward of this is something that I’d love to take a stab at or this is something from a professional development that I want to work on, and I’d love to be able to do that and let in the door that way.
MURIEL WILKINS: Got it. And then once you were in the door, nobody kicked you out.
DENISE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Got it. Listen, Denise, I think you’re being seen. Now, are you being seen in the way that you would like, which is with the formalization of it, or are you being chosen to fit the category that you’d like to be in, which is maybe it’s a more formalized role? That’s a different … But in terms of the value that you’re bringing to these different situations, whether it’s the board or the leadership conversations, you made the ask to be a part of it, somebody said yes. In order for them to say yes, they have to see you. I can’t invite anybody inside my house or I can’t tell somebody to come inside my house if I don’t see them. You’ve ever had that experience? Well, maybe it doesn’t happen that much these days. But people knock on the door and then run away and you’re like, “I don’t see them. I don’t see them. Where are they?” That’s not what’s happening here. You knocked, I opened the door and I see you and I tell you, come in. Okay. So you are seen. I think the question is more about why is that not translating into some formalization … If that’s even a word. Of the value that you bring.
DENISE: Maybe I have to be patient with that.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t know. We haven’t explored that yet.
DENISE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: But I think it’s important to make the distinction because not being seen is really nobody is seeing the value that I bring. Then it’s like, okay, is that value being translated into something tangible? They’re tied together, but they’re two different steps. Before we move on, I want to ask, how much do you see yourself as the leader that you want other people to see you as?
DENISE: I think I’ve tried to be realistic of coming into a more insular environment of okay, that there’s a lot of institutional knowledge here, which is great. And sought out mentors to really learn from that and understand maybe the context. I’ve seen come in past roles in other organizations that I’ve been in that come in hot and want to change everything from the outside. And I think I’ve come in maybe more realistic of understanding okay, this is a more insular organization, sometimes resistant to change. How can I understand the history and the context by seeking out mentors that have more tenure there to build on my knowledge base if I am given that or earn that or get to a place of more leadership responsibilities that I’m not coming in hot to make broad sweeping changes as a newcomer to be disruptive. So I think I’ve tried to be more observant in the time that I’ve been here and learn and try to speak to what I can based on technical background and my outside experience and how I can add value to that. And I think maybe change comes more slowly in the working environment that I’m in.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Understood. And I appreciate the fact that you said, look, you don’t have as long as a tenure as some of these other individuals who’ve been there and we can’t change that. There’s nothing that is within our control where we could accelerate the time and then make everybody else stop. We’re not in a vortex. This isn’t wrinkle in time where I could make everyone else slow down and you speed up and all of a sudden you guys have the same tenure. Not happening. And there’s a reframing for me around what would make you feel like you were an insider in spite of not having as long a tenure as everyone else.
DENISE: I think it’s just this sense of this uphill battle. I can only listen to others’ experiences of what happened decades ago and take that in and learn from that and try to incorporate that context into what I am speaking to. So I don’t know what would make me feel like an insider. Is that just something that builds with years of tenure? I’m not sure. I certainly feel like an outsider and have definitely been referred to as such.
MURIEL WILKINS: In what ways have you been referred to as such?
DENISE: Just being an unfamiliar face to the working environment. It sometimes feels like a pretty tight-knit local community here in the workplace. And having people with tenure at an organization, there’s a lot to learn from that. But sometimes it can feel alienating to someone coming in from the outside not being extended that sense of belonging, that invitation in that type of way.
MURIEL WILKINS: At the start of any coaching conversation, it’s important to level set. Someone might come in with a clearly articulated problem, but I need to dig a bit deeper and understand their line of reasoning before we can really figure out what challenge to tackle and how. In DENISE’s case, she wanted to be seen as a leader at her organization but believed that she wasn’t being seen because of the company’s culture around long tenure and relationship building. Now, reality of the work culture aside, I wanted to get a better sense of the assumptions DENISE was making. Was she really not being seen and what evidence did she have? Not because I didn’t believe her. It actually doesn’t matter what I believe when I coach someone. But more for her to get clear on what her pain point is. Once we were able to parse through whether or not she was being seen as a leader, we could then circle back to the questions around belonging. It’s time to break that problem down a bit. How much is in your control around cultivating a sense of belonging at this organization?
DENISE: I think I’ve made peace that of course I can’t be here in the past and all I can really control is the work that I show up to do and that consistency of showing up and digging into the work and using my skills and building trust with my team to be able to help guide us where we’re going in the future. That I can learn from the past and respect and honor that, but really try to keep the focus on going forward.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what is your measure of belonging? What is it based on or feeling like you’re on the inside? What is that based on?
DENISE: I don’t know. Maybe there’s some of my own bias coming into that, but I think just looking to your left, looking to your right and seeing a much different picture of people who have been there for a really long time compared to someone coming in newer in the grand scheme of things. I think I just try to focus on the work.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. So you focus on the work. Okay. And I understand what your strategy has been. I’m just trying to get a sense of what drives the sense of belonging for you. Because what I’m hearing from you is you look to the left, you look to the right and you see differences in terms of … Let’s just name one, tenure. And based on those differences, it makes you feel what?
DENISE: Maybe still on the outside.
MURIEL WILKINS: But are you technically on the outside?
DENISE: Well, I work there and I show up.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
DENISE: Yeah. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I want to separate out the reality of the situation, which is you are on the inside. You are gainfully employed. As far as we know right now you’re employed, you are going to meetings, sounds like you’re doing a good job. You’ve been there a couple of years. So you are on the inside of the company, but the feeling you have, how you’re experiencing it is as being on the outside. But the reality of it is you are inside and you do belong because you’re there. You got that job.
DENISE: And I feel a great deal of job security too. I don’t think I’m going anywhere, and I’ve been told that too, of the value that I bring and that I’m a key part of the team and the future.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m curious around your internal measure of feeling like you belong. Because what I’ve heard you say up until now is I don’t feel like I belong because of how others are behaving. I don’t even know if they’re behaving a particular way. Are they? That’s why I was saying has some particular things happened? Are they behaving in a particular way that puts you on the outside or that make you feel like you’re being left out?
DENISE: No. Not necessarily. I think just seeing how insular … As you five years in or whatever, see more deeper into the organization and seeing how insular it is. It sometimes feels tough to break into that.
MURIEL WILKINS:
And if you were to break into that, what would that do for you?
DENISE: I don’t know. I think I’m just trying to as I grow and develop in my career and as a leader, really committed to being able to the organization and the mission and the work and really is very fulfilling professionally and want to want to stay here. So really want to work on what I can work on to thrive here.
MURIEL WILKINS: I understand. And I don’t want to lose sight. I’m not dismissing what you’re saying. I just think that we have to be careful of the words that you’re using to describe your experience. And I don’t want you to lose sight of the fact that you are there. I also don’t want to absolve that it is an insular culture, it sounds like. So my question is the goal of breaking into an insular culture or what feels insular, is that goal the one that is going to get you to what you want?
DENISE: I’m not sure. I think coming from a more technical background, I think I used to believe that the work should speak for itself .that you focus on that and that will elevate you and people will just automatically see that. And I think as I’ve developed in my career, I’ve learned that you need to be able to build that net of trust and relationships and communication because if you’re showing up and doing the work, but nobody sees it, does it exist? Is it valued and all that. So I think I’ve really worked to develop on being able to communicate outward and showcase and advocate for things and being able to speak to executive levels to advocate for why our work is important and the priorities and the needs and the goals beyond that. So the internal marketing of the work. I think I’m working on that. And I think I’m just at a point where it’s like, okay, on the personal relationship side, what are some techniques that I can work and build on that to help being seen as a leader because I can’t magically come up with decades of relationship building of where I’m coming in right now? How do you crack that code, I guess?
MURIEL WILKINS: How do you crack that code? So here’s the thing, I hear you around, you’ve understood that the work doesn’t always speak for itself. That you have to go out and communicate it and advocate for it. What also doesn’t speak for itself is wishing and hoping that someone will make the translation that, oh my gosh, this person is doing more in their job or scope and therefore we should formalize it. Now, every now and then we have … I just saw the movie Wicked, so I’m obsessed. We’ll have somebody, some fairy godparent who comes and says, “Oh my goodness, yes. I recognize it, I see it, and we are now going to formalize this thing.” But it doesn’t always happen. And in your case, that seems to be the case. So if that doesn’t happen, what can you do to try to make that happen?
DENISE: Yeah. How can I be a better advocate for myself or how can I help make that happen?
MURIEL WILKINS: So what have you tried?
DENISE: I think I’ve tried in different review and check-in spaces to highlight the work that I’m doing and get feedback on that. Given some of these higher level or leadership projects or responsibilities. And talk about that growth trajectory of what could this turn into the future, how could this lead to a role that spells out some of these responsibilities? So I’ve definitely had those conversations with my manager. I think we’re just in a holding period in the department of making big moves. There’s a be patient type of response.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you’ve made the specific ask for in the way that you shared with me earlier. I want more formal recognition of everything I’m doing, and here’s what it would look like, either a title or a promotion or compensation or scope of responsibilities. You’ve made that specific and ask and you’ve been told be patient. That’s what’s happened?
DENISE: Yeah. I think I’ve tried to put it out there. Definitely had a conversation of this is the work that I’m doing, I want to be recognized for it and I think there’s going to be some more opportunity or I’ve been told there’s been some more opportunity in the future and to be patient and hold tight. And so I’m just wondering if there’s anything I can work on in the meantime, whatever is coming down the pike in the future that might be more in line with what I am hoping for and looking for.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. And what are you being patient for? Meaning what’s supposed to be happening in the meantime that is creating the need to be patient?
DENISE: I’m not sure. I think things in the organization, it’s not a time to upset the apple cart in terms of organization. That it’s not a reorg opportunity right now. So I’m going to see in the next year if there’s maybe some more opportunity for that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Okay. And if you knew the reasons why you need to be patient from an organizational context or from any other context, what would that do for you?
DENISE: I think that might help clarify what is going on the organizational level and how that relates and trickles down to where I’m at and where the team is at. Like I said, I think it’s at this transitional moment organization wide that folks with a lot of tenure are looking towards their next steps, transition in the company. So that’s why I think there’s more … I’ve been told there’s more opportunity in the future. Not super vague. Nothing is promised. But I think there’s more opportunity there. I think I’m just trying to build on my skill sets and the work that I’m doing and how I’m approaching the work and how I am approaching some of these stretch responsibilities that I’m taking on. I feel really good about that and I really like doing that work. How can I make myself the best contributor, manager, leader, potential candidate for something more?
MURIEL WILKINS: And I understand Denise, and I’m not ignoring your question at all. The reason why I’m asking you this is because I think we need to understand if that’s the right question. If the reason you’re not getting the role right now is because there are some things going on organizationally that are completely out of your control or your manager’s control and we have to wait for that wave to pass, is there anything that you could actually do better that could accelerate that? Probably not. And I don’t know .but I want to make sure that you’re focused on the right thing. Now if the other situation is look, even if those opportunities were available, you would not be a candidate because of XYZ, then the answer is, okay, here are the two or three skills that you need to improve on. My concern is that you’re interpreting what is a organizational issue as something that you need to do something about. How does that land with you?
DENISE: Yeah. There are contacts and forces beyond your control in an organization that, yeah, it’s definitely trying to interpret what is going on on an organization level and then filtering down on a team level and whatnot that all blends together and trying to sort that out.
MURIEL WILKINS: So there’s an opportunity for potential clarification that may be helpful to you. And that clarification is the question that I asked you. I understand I need to be patient. Manager, get it. I’ll be patient. What exactly am I being patient for? What needs to happen on the outside? So I think getting that clarification to separate what is happening organizationally with what is happening with you and what’s within your control is important. But let’s assume that there are things that you could do. With your manager have you asked that manager the very question you’re asking me, which is, what are some of the things that I could be working on to make me a viable candidate when those opportunities come up?
DENISE: I haven’t asked that outright like that, so maybe I should.
MURIEL WILKINS: What would stop you from doing so?
DENISE: Maybe just fear.
MURIEL WILKINS: Fear of what?
DENISE: Fear of being told that you’re not a viable candidate for more opportunities in the future.
MURIEL WILKINS: And if that were to happen, what would you do with that?
DENISE: I don’t know. I think I would ask for some more feedback. Really take a look at what might be holding me back.
MURIEL WILKINS: And look, I can understand. A lot of times we don’t ask the question because we’re concerned about what the answer could be. But without the answer, without an understanding, then it’s very hard to navigate how we move forward. And we make up our own assumptions, which leads us back to the beginning of our conversation. So you have a choice. We can play a guessing game around what are the things that you could do or you can try to get more concrete information and feedback and then you have a choice .but at least you’re doing it with eyes wide open.
DENISE: Yeah. Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: How does that feel to you?
DENISE: Scary. But having some more direction and clarity is better than the assumptions of what’s in the dark. So that’s something that I can work with more.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah. And so I’d love to hear from you, what are areas where you’d like to have some more direction and clarity that would make you feel like you know how to hold this time that you’re in when you’re being asked to be patient?
DENISE: I don’t know, to be honest. Where do I fit into the team a couple of years down the line? Where do you see my growth trajectory going? That pathway of what does my future look like here. And I think it’s tough that I talked about this transitional moment company-wide of a lot of folks with tenure there moving on to next chapters in their lives. So I’m not sure if anyone really knows what a couple of years down the road will look like company-wide and team wide. I think there’s some old pathways and ways of doing things that’s very familiar company-wide for folks that have been there for a long time that may be harder to articulate moments of change and what that vision for the future looks like.
MURIEL WILKINS: And do you think that with everything that’s going on in the ecosystem, meaning there’s some resistance to change because things have been ingrained, there’s a culture that precedes you that’s been there a long time. To what extent do you feel like what you’re facing is specifically due to the way that you are leading or positioning yourself? Or do you think anyone who is new in that organization would be experiencing the same thing?
DENISE: I think anyone who is new in the organization would be experiencing some of that to some extent. And I think I’ve witnessed other people come in hot and met with a lot of resistance to change or outside experience. So I think I’m trying to tread very carefully and build trust and work on the collaboration side of things. That when I do present moments of change or different way of doing things, that I have the support of my team and cross-functionally too.
MURIEL WILKINS: Denise, what I’m not hearing in anything that you’re saying—and please correct me if I’ve missed it… is I’m not hearing any evidence that what you’re doing is off-putting, being rejected, not valued. And so there’s a question from me around is it really a matter of you doing things differently than what you’ve been doing or there’s a level of patience that needs to happen exactly what your manager said because it’s keep doing what you’re doing, but it’s going to take longer than you probably would like?
DENISE: That’s a fair point. I think coming in, I did rely heavily on outside experience, technical skills, and I think I did ruffle some feathers at the beginning and have course corrected and learned from that and tried to develop some more on the relationship side and the collaboration side and trust and all that. So I’ve definitely tried to develop and learn and invest in myself. And when being invited inside to some of the more leadership opportunities, being able to learn from that. So I think you’re probably right. It just takes time and building more.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. It might. I don’t know, which is an expectation setting, and then you have a question you have to ask yourself: do I want to be that patient? Which is why I think getting some clarity around what it would take is important. I think the other thing I haven’t necessarily heard, but again tell me if I either missed it or it’s there but we haven’t talked about it, is to what extent have you gotten some data points and some feedback as to whether what you’re doing is working or not to create those connections and those relationships? Not to make them the same as what the tenured people have, but just to create connections and relationships and start building that fabric. To what extent have you gotten any feedback on that?
DENISE: I have received some good feedback in the past six months maybe of some real growth and evolution in how to manage and lead more successfully because of investing in those kind of pathways of communication and trust building. I think it’s something definitely that I’ve intentionally sought out to work on knowing that that’s not necessarily a weakness, but just something that I have less development experience in. And so I have received some good feedback around that.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s a really good sign that the Denise has gotten positive feedback around the work she’s doing in building relationships at her company. A place where relationships seem to be really important. Articulating this also helps differentiate the feeling she’s having of being an outsider from the reality. In a lot of leadership situations where we feel stuck, it’s easy to experience what we’re facing as difficult or even impossible. But without asking directly, we might not really ever know what’s truly going on. So in coaching, I like to have leaders help themselves understand why they might fear speaking up or asking, and then imagine what might happen in that scenario. Often it can help us see more options and become more comfortable with doing the uncomfortable. DENISE is most likely doing what she needs to do in terms of the work and in terms of relationship building, whether that’s enough, she can only know by having more conversations with decision makers. Since that’s hopefully something she can do and do soon we’ll jump back in now by walking through what those conversations could look like. So if you were to have that conversation, what’s the question that you could ask in a way that makes you comfortable but also makes you feel like you would be able to get a response?
DENISE: Yeah. I think I’m hesitant around putting myself out there so directly like that of this is what I want, what would it take for me to get there?
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, what’s the alternative?
DENISE: I don’t know. Doing the work and letting it show for itself.
MURIEL WILKINS: That is a choice. But it’s a choice that you told me you learned a while back, didn’t quite work.
DENISE: It’s not enough. It’s like you need that foundation of the work.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. I think what we’re getting at is do the work, let the work speak, but you also have to speak for yourself and that a part of that is being able to articulate what it is that you want and be ready for whatever answer you’re going to get. Because without that answer, you don’t know what your next move needs to be. I’m not in a position to be able to tell you what to work on. So the question is right, but you’ve got to be able to address it with the people who would actually be able to give you an answer. What would make you feel more courageous in being able to ask that question?
DENISE: I think I’ve shied away from the conversations like that that could be interpreted as overt political positioning. Trying to angle your way to a higher position. Maybe just building the courage. I don’t know.
MURIEL WILKINS: In what way could you have that conversation in a way that didn’t make it feel like you were angling politically to get to a higher position?
DENISE: I think I have a really great relationship with my manager and a lot of trust is there and open communication. I would feel comfortable having these types of conversations. Yeah. I’m not sure what’s holding me back from the courage to be more forthright of this is where I would want to go. How can I get there?
MURIEL WILKINS: What are you concerned would happen if you did do that?
DENISE: I don’t know. Maybe there’s more hurdles and things to work on than I realized. Or maybe there’s a path that has fewer opportunities for growth that I’m hoping for.
MURIEL WILKINS: Maybe there is and maybe there’s not. We don’t know. And really, I am agnostic. I just want you to have choices. The choices is you can operate in not knowing and hoping that what you’re doing is going to make the mark. It’s like shooting darts in the dark and hoping it hits the target. And the other choice is put it out there, bring some light to it and see if you get a response so that then you actually know what the target is. The target will either be, I’m either on the right path or I’m not on the right path, so now I know what I need to do to course correct, or it’s still unclear what the path is, which would bring you right back to where you are right now. But at least you’ll know there’s a reason you are where you are now. Does the fear need to not exist for you to be able to have the conversation?
DENISE: No. But I think that the clarity of having the conversation to bring air to it, I think is a good thing of what is the path forward? I think feedback is so important as a learning opportunity, so being able to be open and forthright about the path that I’m on. And given over the past years, some of the bigger projects that I’ve been able to take lead on, how can we continue that in the future?
MURIEL WILKINS: In a way, Denise, it’s interesting because I feel like by not putting yourself out there in the way that we just described it, you are reinforcing the sense of being on the outside.
DENISE: Yeah. I think those pesky assumptions come into play when you’re in the dark.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. When we’re in the dark, we can’t even really see if we’re in the inside or the outside. Can’t we?
DENISE: Just trying to feel for the door. Where’s the door?
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. Feel for the door. Feel for the door. Exactly. Exactly. So I know that your original question was, what do I do in order to position myself? How do I thrive as an outsider where being an insider is more valued? I think there’s some data that you need to even be able to make that determination. But in the process of getting that data, you’re setting the path to be able to make choices in terms of how you thrive. I’m curious whether approaching it from the perspective of insider and outsider, in what way does that help you in terms of what you’re trying to achieve?
DENISE: No. It feels very divisive. I don’t think it’s helpful, and I think I’ve bristled to that type of labeling when hearing it in a workplace environment.
MURIEL WILKINS: And in no way am I suggesting that there is not an insider outsider culture. I don’t want to ignore that that’s what you’re experiencing. All I’m asking is does that question help you get to what you’re trying to achieve? And if the answer is, I don’t know, I bristle at it, I’m not quite sure, then the question becomes, okay, in what other way could I frame this to help me get to what I want, which is to understand what it would take for me to be formally recognized in this role? So in what way could you reframe the question for yourself in a way that actually helps you move towards the goal that you want?
DENISE: How can I lead forward with purpose and with those relationships of trust and collaboration, how can I build on my skill set to be a better leader I guess?
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. How did that question feel for you relative to your concern around coming off as politically angling for a higher role?
DENISE: I think it’s more reflective and focused on what more proactive, what I can do. How I can grow and develop on my own skill sets of within the realm of my control. How I can add value and push forward and focus on the work and the team. Not so much on the labels.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And so your manager is somebody that you could have that conversation with. Are there other roles within the organization … And I’m asking this specifically because it’s an organization that’s deep in terms of relationships and connections. Are there others within the organization that you think … And you don’t have to name them. But that you think it would be worthy to be able to get that type of feedback and have that type of conversation with?
DENISE: Yeah. And I’ve definitely had that type of conversation with another mentor that I’ve developed in the organization that does have a lot of tenure. So I’ve been able to be open about where I am seeing myself and where I’d like to see myself in the future. I don’t know where to go from here.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. The question is are you getting the answers that you like?
DENISE: Yeah. I think it’s similar to the patience and focus on the work and building upon your own skills and taking an honest look about what some things are to develop on. I think they’ve all been within that realm. And I’ve also heard some different perceptions that I’ve brought up to my mentor who does have a lot of tenure here. That feeling of feeling like an outsider to an insider environment. And she actually said that was interesting because as somebody who has been there for a long time, her perception was that a lot of times there is almost the opposite of feeling undervalued being there for a long time versus some new hotshot coming in wanting to shake things up. That there’s often a perception of looking to the outside for a magic solution of this person will come in and solve all the problems. So that was definitely broadened my understanding and perception of what the other side might look like.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s so interesting to me because in both cases it is defining your value relative to the other. You are defining your value or measuring your value in comparison to those who have been there for a longer period of time. This individual that you spoke to is measuring it relative to the people who are coming in. That’s fine but that’s always going to be a moving target. And so my question for you is how do you measure your own value? What is it based on? How do you ground it in something concrete? Which is why I think these conversations around, well, let me understand if the opportunity did show up, what are the things that would be needed? And then let me take an honest look at myself to say, do I have them? Do I not? And if I don’t, then do I want to do something about them? And how? In the same way that you have done when you join this organization to say, “Oh, I’m great at technical skills, but I see now I need to be able to build the collaboration and the trust, et cetera, so I’m going to build that muscle and I’m going to use it a lot more.” Same thing. You made that assessment. My sense is it’s probably time for another baseline assessment.
DENISE: Yeah. And I think being on the other side of some of these growth opportunities and projects that went really well from feedback and were successful … I think taking stock of, okay, that definitely was a stretch and definitely built on some skillsets that were some muscles that were underdeveloped and how can I incorporate that learning back into the work and like you said, how I see that value of what I bring.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yep. So I think we’ve talked about some tactical things that you can do. I want to make sure that we’re also paying attention to the cultural aspects of this organization, which is you have joined an organization that has a certain culture as do all organizations. And this one, as you named it … You named it as being insular. That there are deep-rooted relationships based on tenure and how long people have been around. So you’re able to name it and see it for what it is. And there’s a question for me around to what extent are you okay with working in that type of culture?
DENISE: It’s one of the things that makes the organization really unique that people want to stick around for a long time. And that’s rare. There’s a lot of institutional knowledge in that and there’s a lot of close relationships that have been formed and that you see that community aspect of where you work. One of the things that drew me to this role in this company, so I think I definitely want to be here and to work towards that shared purpose that’s there and maybe evolve the culture a little bit.
MURIEL WILKINS: And maybe evolve the culture a little bit. And so one of the things that may be helpful is to ask yourself, how do I leverage the strengths of this culture to help me accomplish my goals? And you just named what the things are that you appreciate about it, what the strengths are. So when I frame the question that way, what is your first reaction to it? How do you think you could leverage the strengths of it to support you on your path?
DENISE: Asking for feedback and advice and learning from those who’ve come before me in the organization. I think trying to understand as much of that. Being in that listening and understanding sponge mode to pick up the lessons. I think an element of that is being patient too, of not being in a executive leadership role at the moment where if I wanted to make broad sweeping changes, I’m certainly not in a position right now to do that .but maybe just taking in as much as I can learn from the people who are still here to help direct what decisions I might have to make in the future.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And what’s interesting, Denise, is people think that when they are in that executive role, they can make those broad sweeping changes all of a sudden and that is not the case. They try, but especially in a culture like that, it backfires. So potentially this is practice ground for when you are in that role. When that time comes.
DENISE: I’d like to think that you have limited capital for making change so being very specific and targeted and focused with that capital of how to use it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. And particularly again in an organization where it sounds like social capital is very valued, one of the ways that you could be spending the time that you have now is building that social capital. And so when we talk about leveraging the strengths of the organization, which is the relational aspects, the deep institutional knowledge, when we talk about there’s change happening or things that are going to be happening, but we need to wait for some of this movement to happen, there’s no way you can accelerate it. What can you be doing in the meantime? Build your own social capital. Which it sounds like you’ve been doing. So it’s more around, do more of it. I wish I could tell you here’s the one, two, three in terms formalizing the value that you bring, but there’s so much more at play outside of what’s in your control right now. That said, I think there are some things that you can do. Okay. So I’d love to hear from you how you feel now at the end of our conversation versus how you felt when we first started.
DENISE: When we first started, I felt a little more in the dark of the path forward and assumptions maybe were coloring some of that a lot more. So naming what the assumptions are helped give light to what is an interpretation and what is the data behind my perception of where I’m at. Breaking it apart and giving light to all of those things, I do think that honest look of another baseline assessment and conversation with my manager and other mentors that I have in the organization would help give more light to what is that path forward. It feels like when you’re going down a trail and you’re like, “Wait a second. Is this the right trail? I can’t see the path forward.” So it’s like taking that moment to stop and look at the clues around you of what can you see? What are those trail markers? What does that map? Where am I? What can I perceive? And all that just is data that gives more light to what that path forward is. So I definitely feel better about having those conversations, but then also being patients. To understand that maybe just because I’m ready to take on some more leadership responsibilities, that those things aren’t necessarily ready for me to take them on.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. That’s right. The two have to be aligned. And while clarity in the path is necessary, sometimes all that’s necessary to be able to take one step forward on that path is clarity on what that next step is without seeing the whole way. Okay. And I think you have a little bit more clarity, as you said than you did at the outset, and now take the next step. What’s the next step of getting more clarity? Okay. Thank you.
DENISE: Thank you.
MURIEL WILKINS: Organizational cultures will have an impact on your career and your leadership, and they can be an uphill battle to fight or change. But if you decide to wait it out to see if those changes come to fruition, it can be helpful to focus on setting a clear goal, communicating that goal with your leadership and working on the skill building and relationship building that you need to reach that goal. These are all hopeful ways to focus your energy while at the same time paying attention to whether there is movement on the organizational side of things. While we all love a clear list of actions coming out of a coaching session, a reframing of the problem statement or perspective is just as impactful and necessary to move to meaningful action. Such was the case for Denise as she went from seeing the organizational culture as an obstacle to a possible opportunity. By making a commitment to have more exploratory conversations with leadership and spending the time to build more social capital she’s leveraging the strengths of the culture versus fighting against it.

Episode 2: How Should I Plan for My Next Role When I’m Happy with the One I’m In?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders, part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them, so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Gia to protect her confidentiality. She’s had a career spanning multiple industries and continents. Her previous role marked a turning point in her career.
GIA: It was the first time I was managing a large team, and I found myself. I found myself in many different ways. Initially, I found myself in a city that I absolutely loved, and I felt really embraced and welcomed. I really was welcomed by the team, and such a diverse team, which also I truly appreciate because it brings the right challenges for a leader.
MURIEL WILKINS: Gia then pursued a new opportunity at a different organization. She wasn’t sure she would get that job, but she did, and she feels really grateful that it’s been the right fit for her.
GIA: There’s many times in my life that I got the job, and it was not the right fit for me. I can assure you that I was almost fired probably so many times in my career, and now I’m so humbled by it and I’m actually thankful. I feel that over time I became more intentional and also more aware of my strengths to apply to the right jobs. The last two ones were exactly that case. It was really intentional. I really, really wanted them and I had a feeling that it was the right challenge for me.
MURIEL WILKINS: Gia has now been at the company for about a year.
GIA: It’s the first time that I am completely in love with my job. I absolutely love the company and the company culture especially, and my peers and the team I manage. I truly feel I manage it to deliver the impact and from the performance reviews that I received, even over deliver the impact that was expected. And I continuously feel challenged because when you manage a team that large, there’s always something. And I feel like I have the right level of curiosity to go into all of these situations in a very humble way, try to understand them and where people are coming from and finding solutions.
So, I’m really thriving there and I love it. And I think it’s important to say one more thing because I’m from, I feel that it shows me also why sometimes it’s so important to have all of that pain and happiness of being raised in a country like this with so many challenges because all of those challenges since you were born make you creative because you have to find solutions every day to survive. And that brings you this level of creativity in finding solutions. And I think because of that, I’m thriving at what I do.
MURIEL WILKINS: Gia is very content in her current situation and is thus facing an interesting challenge around how to plan her next steps when she’s actually happy and comfortable where she is. I’ll let her explain in her own words.
GIA: I feel like I’m at this point that I am in a very good position to really continue to be intentional to build my long-term plan in the company I’m at. Of course, I’m thinking a lot about it and I’m about to have career growth conversations where I am, and I really want to pause and think of, okay, what does that look like for me? If I look into my career so far, it was not a stare that you go from manager, director, and now I think it’s that moment that I can really intentionally think about that.
Of course, it’s not a short-term plan, but it’s how can I continue to bring impact and not be scared of the next step and build that next step for myself and understand first what is it second, what to do about it and how to get there. And at the same time, there is always this fear in me. What if I do it and I’m not good at it? Or what if I do it and I don’t enjoy it as much as I’m enjoying what I’m doing now, but also what if I don’t do it and I don’t build this plan and I stop enjoying what I’m doing now because it’s going to be like two years, three years. And you get into that comfort zone. And I really am a person that I love being challenged and I love feeling curious about learning. And of course, at the same time, it’s important to me the validation to feel that I’m delivering results and that I’m bringing impact as well.
MURIEL WILKINS: So let me just step back and make sure that I’m hearing you fully. So, you’re in a place where you’re doing well, right? For all intents and purposes, and you’re starting to think about how do you intentionally use, in your words, how do you intentionally think through what’s next for you within this company?
GIA: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, it’s not about what’s next for you outside, but more like how can you create a plan for yourself that gives you longevity within the company? And a part of that is thinking through what the possible next step could be. How do you prepare for that next step? And then the third component is, but what if I get there and then I don’t like it? Or what if I get there and then I can’t do it? So, there’s one side of it, but then the other side of it is, but if I stay in the position that I’m in and not look for that next step, I know myself sooner or later, I’m not going to feel challenged and then I’ll be stuck here and that won’t be comfortable.
GIA: That is a perfect summary of it.
MURIEL WILKINS: All right. So, you mentioned that when I asked you what has changed over time, or you mentioned there were times you didn’t get the right job or it didn’t work out, but as you became more intentional, you were able to find roles like you’re in today or companies like you’re in today where the fit is way more aligned. So, when you think about your desire now to be intentional about your next step, and you think about when you have been intentional, how do you define intentionality for you? What does it look like when you’re being intentional?
GIA: It’s about really taking a look inside and taking the time to listen to myself and to be honest with myself about again, my strengths and my shortcomings. Of course, investing time in it to work through it and really face it and making sure that the decision is really fought through that there are no guarantees. And sometimes we get lured with external things that don’t matter. So, I think it’s a stripping down to what is really important to me and that fits my values. And one thing to tell you that stopped mattering to me a while back. And of course, it does matter, but it’s not the key component is money. For example, if I’m happy where I am, I’m not going to go somewhere else because they offer me more money because I already understood that this doesn’t bring the happiness and the motivation to enjoy what you’re doing. That’s what intention means to me.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So really honing in on what matters to you?
GIA: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, let’s bring that into the equation. When we talk about your next step as you’re defining a next step for yourself, what falls in that circle of what matters?
GIA: Absolutely would need to continue to manage large teams, because that’s what I’m passionate about. And honestly, that’s what I feel I can bring the most value. I wouldn’t see myself as an individual contributor or managing a small team because those are the problems that I love to solve, is really how to make a team work together and have psychological safety and feel that they can grow and so on. So that is one thing.
The second thing is definitely who is my manager, because another thing I’ve learned in my career is that having a manager that also has a great, not only a manager, but a team. So, my people, the people who report into the same manager, I honestly feel like all of these teams, they ideally would complete each other in a way. And I do feel like in the interviewing process, it’s always good to also understand the management style. And again, no guarantees because I could join a team and have that manager and six months in that person goes into their next career move. So, if I can always manage those variables, I think those are the most important things.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, what matters to you is managing a large team because of all the ingredients that go into that and that you feel like that’s a little bit of your superpower where you get a lot of juice, and then also who your manager is, but also the larger team, maybe your peers, the interrelationships and interdependencies sound like they’re important to you.
GIA: Yes, exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, what I hear from that is whatever you do next, you would like those to be the two main variables and ingredients.
GIA: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, help me understand, Gia, if we were to broaden this question and ask what matters to your company, how would you answer that? So, if your company was a person, what matters to the company?
GIA: I genuinely feel that people matter to the company and that comes out with the culture of the company. And another thing that truly matters to the company is the impact we have on the planet and in people’s lives and having real values and not something that we just put on.
MURIEL WILKINS: When you think about where you can optimize what matters for you and what matters for the company, what does that look like for you?
GIA: I guess probably teams that are going through hard times that are going through change management, have been without a leader for a while or a bumpy road, things that really are in need of care and they didn’t have leaders that were understanding of different cultures, etc. Very diverse teams, because I truly love the diverse aspect. There is a book called the Culture Map that I absolutely love everything that goes around this theme. And working in EMEA, you work with so many different cultures. So, I think that that’s normally where I could probably bring the most impact and really bring a lot of psychological safety and safety.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so, with that, teams that are going through a hard time, change management, may have gone through a bumpy road, may have lacked leadership in the past, they’re diverse in terms of culture is where you feel like you would be able to add value. And actually, what it sounds like, build on the strengths that you already have and just put them in a different situation. So, with that as the profile, when you think about what’s next for you, what could that look like in terms of a next step? How do you formulate that in terms of what’s next?
GIA: I would love to have that answer. I believe that I would exclude already markets that teams are not that diverse or maybe even markets that then I would not exclude. If they are open to bringing diversity, I’m in a very good place physically because you have all of these countries and all of these. It’s the easiness to hire diverse. And I would definitely think about location. I’m very open to moving and diverse. For me, definitely Asia is a part of my equation because that sparks my curiosity because it would be diverse for me, and I would learn a lot from it.
And maybe I could bring a lot of this diversity that I would bring to the table. So, there are different bits of diversity in terms of large teams. I definitely can see many instances where I could manage larger teams than I’m managing right now, and that could be the next row above where I am right now. But it could also be any role in a director level that is in the customer-facing kind of environment. So, whether it’s customer service, whether it’s sales, whether it’s E-com, commercial, because I do enjoy people, I do enjoy customers, and I love working backwards from customers and listening to customers and always trying to build this bridge. So, in that sense, it can be as wide as operational roles or commercial roles.
MURIEL WILKINS: It sounds like you have some clarity on that what’s next could look like as still maintaining the diversity aspect, but it might be in a different location or the composition might be different, but it’s still diverse because that’s a core value of yours in terms of what you want and what matters to you. And then the other piece is what’s next? If we think about it again as a step is that it’s a step up in terms of the size of the team. Scaling up would be the difference in the challenge or the mandate, if you will. And then with a larger team, the other part that might be a different variable than what you have now is it could be a larger team in the same area of focus that you have now. So, sort of same vertical if you will, or it’s a larger team where you move to a different but still customer-facing area of the business.
GIA: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, what you’re starting to see is there are different variations of what that next step could look like, which is great. Now you have choice.
GIA: Sometimes choices are great, sometimes they’re scary.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yes. What makes it scary?
GIA: What if I make the wrong choice and it doesn’t work out? And I take that hit in the validation part of me that of course I need to work on. And it’s like going to a restaurant and you have a really long menu and you’re completely like, okay, what do I want to eat? And I know it’s what we’re doing here. Okay, let’s go through blocks. Do you want to eat meat, fish? And then you go, and you start to trim down. But that’s the scary part of having choices.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I’m curious for you, what does happen when you go to the restaurant, and you get the dish and it’s not the dish you like? What do you do?
GIA: Oh, well, it depends. I don’t think we should.
MURIEL WILKINS: No, not we. I want to know what you do.
GIA: I, I. Okay. That’s a great one. Look, that’s a tough question because I want to be mindful that we are in a world where food is so important, but in a scenario where I get to choose if the food is not good, I would rather order something else and eat something that I absolutely love because I think life is too short to not eat something you absolutely adore when you can. But also, being mindful that I wouldn’t want to waste food, and again, I would probably feel that battle that I’m telling you right now.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean maybe there’s an and there, right? So, let’s play this out, because I find this so fascinating. I find it fascinating because when sometimes we go out to eat as a family and my partner will order a glass of wine and they give him a tasting. He’s very picky about his wine and he doesn’t like it. He’s like, no, no, no, no. I’ll send it back. And my kids are mortified that he sent the wine back and we’re trying to explain to them, this is the beauty of the world. You have choice. But he only got a little bit of the wine. He didn’t let them fill the whole glass before he said. So, I want to ask you, how do you translate this notion of being in the restaurant, ordering the dish, not liking the dish, and in your heart, knowing life is too short, I want to enjoy the dish and I want to be mindful of not wasting, how would you optimize both of those things?
I know we’re talking about restaurants, but I actually think there’s something, how would optimize there? Yeah, how would you optimize both courts correcting the choice so that it aligns with what matters to you, which is a dish that you like, and making sure that it’s not being wasted? What could you do in that situation?
GIA: I can only speak about myself, right?
MURIEL WILKINS: Of course.
GIA: I can give ideas to the restaurant and I can already imagine how to tie it to a job where you can do job rotation, et cetera. It’s what your husband does. It’s kind of like a job rotation of the wine. Oh, I’m going to taste just a little bit. There is no waste. I’m not committing to this wine yet. Then you don’t feel guilty about it with the food, honestly, I think if it is really terrible, I’m definitely not going to, if it’s terrible, I mean to my taste, there is no problem with the restaurant and so on. I’m probably going to not eat it but stick to it and leave the restaurant and eat something at home, which is not ideal. Depending on the event. If it’s a one-time opportunity in that restaurant and it’s a restaurant that I’ve been wanting a table for so long, I will definitely order a second dish and just live with it. But ideally, I would have a small, the wine, this dish, we have a tiny taste of it.
MURIEL WILKINS: And you could also say, which is what I do sometimes when I’m not sure, I’m like, I warn the person bringing the food. I say, I’m going to order this. If I don’t like it, can I get something else? So, they agree before they even give me the dish, right? That’s my coping mechanism. That’s my coping mechanism. We all have our coping mechanism. Let’s bring it back to work. So how does all this translate to work for you? Let’s say you found the job that you thought was going to give you all the things, the larger team, same role or a different customer-facing role, diverse. But then you get there and it’s like, ah, this isn’t the dish that I thought I ordered. What would you do?
GIA: Oh, wow. So I don’t even have a chance to course correct before the dish. Let’s do that.
MURIEL WILKINS: You could, but let’s assume you took it.
GIA: I would give it some time. I would give it some time because also what I’ve learned is that time has an immense ability to make things clearer. So the first thing I would do is really give it some time and try to understand what are the parts of the dish that are not making me happy in this case of the job that are not making or doesn’t feel like what I applied for and truly understand if over time those things are going to be a constant and they’re always going to be there, and therefore I’m always going to be unhappy about it.
And I think at the end of the day, you have to be transparent about it when the time comes because it’s only fair that you make a choice in a job that you’ve never done before in a team that you’ve never worked with before. And it may happen that it doesn’t work out, and it may happen that it doesn’t work out from my side, but it may not work out from the team’s side, from the management’s side. And I think it should be tied back to that psychological safety within the company of me knowing that I’m valued and now we’re going to find something else and we’re going to find something that is going to be a good fit. And I’m going to own my, I wouldn’t even call it a mistake, but I would owe my choice or own it and course-correct it but face it and not stick with it just for the sake of.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you for that because what is coming up for me as you’re sharing this, Gia, is that in order for you to take any next step, which by the way you’ve done before, you started off saying part of why you’ve been able to move to different things and have jobs that didn’t work out and then move to the ones, and they did work out, and you’ve moved to a tremendous amount of different countries and probably what enables you to really work with diverse teams where things are not the same across is because of, as you put it, the way you grew up. It taught you to be resourceful, it taught you to be creative. And what creativity is to me is the ability to deal with the unknown. If things were known, we wouldn’t have to create. But what I really appreciate about what you said when you say around you find what matters to you is creating psychological safety for others.
What you’re talking about now is creating psychological safety for yourself in taking these next steps. And one thing, I know there’s a lot that is talked about when it comes to the term psychological safety, and one thing that I think is important is only you can understand how to create your own psychological safety. Part of it is what we also call, it’s not necessarily knowing, hey, this is exactly what the plan is going to be. It’s knowing that if you were to take that next step, if it goes well, you’ll be able to handle it. And if it doesn’t go as expected, even though you might not like it, you would be able to handle it. So let me pause there. How does that resonate with you?
GIA: It totally resonates, and thank you for reminding me of that, that I’ve done it before. I guess I had less to lose than I have now. Right? That’s what makes this one really scary because I really enjoy where I am, but it’s really good to be reminded that that’s the thing. For me, the challenge is part of life, and the unknown is actually the beauty of it, and that’s where I thrive. If there was no unknown, also no company probably would need me because that’s where all my childhood and major years and everything else built this strength of, okay, it’s a challenge. Let’s unpack it and let’s solve it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Gia’s challenge is around planning for her future career, even while happy and content in her current role, in part because of that contentment, one baseline to set with her in this coaching session was really articulating what she loved about her current role. Put another way. I asked her to define some of the values she holds most dearly in her work and how her role aligns with those values. That clarity can then help guide her along the path to whatever positions open up before her, but beyond the calculus of what an organization has to offer to make it worth her while.
I also wanted to explore the risk and inherent fear that potentially lay behind this question she brought to the table, because ultimately to make a choice can feel like a risk because it means making a trade-off when what we want is to have it all. That risk might seem even riskier when you’re jumping into the unknown from a comfortable position. Now that we’ve spent some time with Gia gaining clarity on what she needs to feel fulfilled in a job and why she might be apprehensive about making a change, we can now move forward with a proactive plan for her next career move as opposed to a reactive one. But that may require a slight change in her perspective.
I’m curious, what if your approach to this was not grounded in what you have to lose, right? You said you have more to lose now. What if it was grounded in what you have to gain? What difference would that make for you?
GIA: A total difference, because yeah, it’s just shifting the focus, right? It’s the cup half full, right? So yes, that’s a great point. I think it’s more important to really focus on what do I have to gain about the thing I lose? Let’s face it. Maybe I also have to gain, because it’s experience and if you face it the right way, it’s always going to sum up to your repertoire or professional repertoire and personal repertoire. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And look, here’s the truth of it. It’s never a zero-sum game. You’re one person, so it’s not like you’re either losing or you’re gaining. We’re always constantly operating in both. It’s like you’re breath. You don’t just exhale, and you don’t just inhale to live.
GIA: I love it.
MURIEL WILKINS: You have to do both. I mean, try it. I just tried it. It doesn’t work. I can’t inhale for forever. At some point I’ve got to exhale. And so, the capacity to be able to approach this next step is not from an either or. It’s from a, as I look at the opportunities that are in front of me, I look at them as a, there are things I might gain and there are things that I might lose. What does the whole picture look like? And does that whole picture fit with what matters to me? Which is what you started with.
GIA: That makes total sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
GIA: Wow.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, I think you actually some clarity around what a next step could look like. So, what would you need to know or what would you need to answer for yourself in terms of how you move towards that next step?
GIA: I guess that’s the part where I have no clarity. There are definitely steps that are more straightforward. I have a mentor in the company that I absolutely adore and having career growth conversations with my direct manager and being very frank and honest about them and making sure that I have a succession plan. So, if I do leave in let’s say one year time to another role, there is someone on the team that can step up, which it’s always the best approach. So really preparing the foundation, I think it’s one thing.
And the other part of the foundation is once I know what it is, what are the strengths that I need to gain that I don’t have yet to get there? And what does it look for me to get there? Because it’s a very competitive universe in the sense that any role that I applied for, I would be competing with highly capable professionals because that’s what happens when I’m hiring for my team as well.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right, right, right, right. What’s interesting to me though is what you have outlined in terms of as you’ve been intentional, which you defined intentionality in terms of really being able to hone in on what matters, and that is what you’re going for, and that is why you’ve figured out you’ve been able to attain now positions and companies where there actually is very tight alignment for you. What’s interesting to me is the way you articulated what a next step is very specific. It’s very specific to what aligns with what you have articulated as your strengths.
So, I think it would be a great question to ask if you shared with your mentor or others, hey, here’s what I’m thinking about as my next step, which is basically a scaling up of the type of team that I’m working with, leveraging my strengths in working with a diverse team, potentially being in a different geography or customer facing role. Is there anything that I need to be doing differently now that would increase my probability of being able to attain that type of role?
GIA: That’s amazing.
MURIEL WILKINS: But I don’t know. It sounds like you’re leveraging strengths, like you’re not coming from a place of deficit, but that’s something that you should test out with others.
GIA: Yes. That’s amazing. I would love to have that power of communication you have, Muriel, come with me to the conversation.
MURIEL WILKINS: No. Oh, well, you tell me. Let’s say, because you’re about to sit down for career progression.
GIA: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Career conversations. So, tell me how could you frame what it is that you want? I don’t know who you have that conversation with. Is it your mentor?
GIA: My direct manager.
MURIEL WILKINS: Your direct manager. Okay. So, I’m the direct manager, blah, blah, blah. We get, what do you want to talk about today, Gia?
GIA: I guess I would be very transparent. I’m having all of these conversations and I feel like I’m in a safe place, and I would love to just honestly talk about and very transparently talk about my next step in the company. I absolutely want to continue in the company, but I feel like I truly want to bring more impact. And at the same time, if I feel about what I need, I also need to know that what comes next is going to continue to challenge me and spark my curiosity. And when I think about it, and I think about being very intentional about it, if I have to say two main aspects of the next role would be to manage scale up a large team, so larger the team than the team that I manage now, and working with diverse teams and geography is not a problem.
I’m a person that I actually absolutely love facing these challenges of moving into different geographies. So, I guess first of all, knowing me and knowing my skills and knowing also my development areas and knowing the company for a longer time than I know, what is your view on that next step? What would you say it is and when do you think I would be ready for it? And also, what would I need to do to get there? What are the development areas that you still see for me in getting there?
MURIEL WILKINS: You got it. You got it. I think the only, if I may, if I could give you a little suggestion is break those questions up. Let him answer the first, because it’d be interesting to hear his perspective. Does he also think that’s the right next? It does he have some other things around what the next move could be? And then it’s like, oh, so when you look at where I am now, what experiences do you think I would need to gain in the next year or two or however long it takes me to be able to do that? Let him share. What do you think that timing is? So, scaffold it out, stagger it out so that you give yourself the opportunity to get all of the responses that you need to help inform how you best position yourself.
GIA: That makes total sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So now let’s imagine you have this conversation, and you have more information. What would be the one ask that you would have to your manager that would help you on this intentionality around what’s next and moving towards what’s next?
GIA: One ask. I only have one.
MURIEL WILKINS: Let’s start with one.
GIA: Okay, good. I want choices. You sold me choices. I guess support and support can come in many different ways, but depending on what that next step is, let’s say, oh, I think a geography move would make a lot of sense. And the APAC team absolutely would take so much value of having someone with your strengths, et cetera. Let’s find synergy for me to go to APAC and meet the team and spend some time with the team there and still deliver to my current job, but also support me into selling myself and getting to know the right people and all of this support I’ve been having in terms of exposure to leadership, presenting and having a mentor. So, I think it’s this continuous support, again, very intentional because once we know what that next step looks like, we can be even more intentional about that support. So, it’s like this continuous support, and the difference will be it’s going to be more laser focused.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, so there you go. You have your ask, right? And you can define what, as you said, what the support is that you want and need in order to keep it moving, right? Keep this needle moving versus letting him figure it out. And he might have some ideas. You want to listen to that, and you want to also be ready to say, Hey, based on what you’ve shared, here are the two or three things where I could use support and what it could look like. Could you do that? And then you follow up, right?
GIA: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s very important to define how people can support you because the way most people think that they should support you may not necessarily be the way you want support. So, make sure that you have that ready.
GIA: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it’s not something we should take for granted. You may get lost in translation, and what I find is that really framing it and being very specific about things makes it a lot easier to align in expectations, but at the same time, it’s not always we do this double-checking communication. Am I being very clear here? So, thank you for that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, absolutely. Okay. You have laid out the whole process for yourself. Now you just got to go find it. So, tell me, I think we can hone in towards the end here. What do you feel now that you didn’t necessarily have your arms wrapped around when you walked into this conversation?
GIA: I guess my main outcome from this conversation is look at what do I have to gain in the next step. And then from there, what I know now that I didn’t know before we talked is it was all here. The whole growth conversation, it was kind of here, but it was not organized, and I was not asking myself the right questions. You did, and you guided me through it, and now I understand that this is how I frame what matters to me, to myself, and from there, it’s easier for me to really understand, okay, what are the possible next steps? And to have this conversation with my manager and really frame it. This is where my mind’s at and ask question by question to really understand also his opinion and where his mind is at, and then from there have a clear ask of what is the support that I need then to get there. So, I guess it’s the structure and the positivity of thinking of the gains and not the losses.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. So, what I’m going to leave you with is in the future when you’re facing choices, whether it’s a choice of next step or choice of restaurant meal, ask yourself the same questions. You have the capacity to do that. You’ve done it through your ways of being intentional. You’re just doing it in a different way, but ask yourself, what do I have to gain and what do I have to lose? What choices are in front of me? What about this? Have I done before that? It may look different, but it’s actually quite similar. What would I need to believe to actually go through with this and focus on the gain rather than the loss? Ask yourself the questions, right? And that will then build your capacity. The challenges don’t go away, but your capacity to deal with them gets stronger and stronger every time you ask yourself those questions, okay?
GIA: That’s perfect. I think I’m going to order much better food. Thank you so much, Muriel. It’s been great.
MURIEL WILKINS: Of course, thank you. As you grow into your career and become more and more intentional in the roles you take, making a change can feel riskier and riskier. Why go from something you know and love into something unknown? A really helpful exercise in being able to thrive in that unknown is to take stock of what is most valuable to you and your work, your non-negotiables, no matter what title or company you end up with.
After we sorted out those priorities with Gia, we were able to examine a bit more about what exactly she was fearful of and how we could potentially reframe her concerns. Finally, once she had these guideposts, she was able to quickly determine actionable next steps in her work to help her get to where she wanted to go. Even if you are content, there’s always an opportunity for growth. Whether you’re itching to get to the next rung of the ladder or happy in a long-term job, reframing how you think about change can be really helpful. That’s it for this episode of Coaching Real Leaders. Next time …
JOHN: When it comes down to C-suites or boards, the insecurity will come out and I will start this internal loop of second guessing in deciding when to speak or what to say, and then I end up either saying nothing or worse kind of saying something I’m not very proud of.

MURIEL WILKINS: I am Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road.
My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that, hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Alex to protect his confidentiality.
ALEX: So, I’m probably what you call a seasoned consultant. I’ve spent most of my professional years as a advisor or in the consulting industry. I started out as a Big 4 consultant. I worked my way up to becoming a experienced senior manager, as they say.
When I was looking at what the partner track looked like and what the managing director track looked like, I realized the amount of travel and the lifestyle was not what I wanted. So I got off the road and end up doing more local consulting, which is really a lot more individual contributor type of roles.
MURIEL WILKINS: Alex spent time at a number of firms, eventually leaving consulting for a VP position at a small company. Some roles have felt like a better fit than others. Even in some consulting gigs that were meant to have an end date, Alex was asked to stay on because of the value he adds, and that has given him more of a sense of the kind of executive positions he would really enjoy.
ALEX: So that’s another thing that I’ve found as a theme in my career is that I’ll land in a spot and then continue to add value where clients or whoever I’m working with will continue to extend me because I always find different opportunities to try to be a valuable contributor to an organization.
From a recognition standpoint, it was important to me to be recognized for what I brought to the table. And then also when I say season, I’m at an age where it’s like you start thinking like,
Oh my gosh, I have to do this all over again to get back to someplace I’ve already been multiple times before.
MURIEL WILKINS: Alex is feeling like he still hasn’t quite gotten to where he wants to be in his career, despite having some good experiences.
ALEX: In my head, I’ve always had this goal of being an executive in some kind of organization. There’s something holding me back from being either seen or me being proactive and identifying the things that I need to work on to be viewed as that senior executive or that can operate at an executive level, whatever that looks like.
Even when I was in a big consulting firm, right, there’s something holding me, I feel like, from being viewed as a partner or leader in the firm to just being that senior manager in perpetuity, and that is a theme that I felt like has been even throughout my consulting career. And there’s times where, Well, maybe I was meant to be a lifelong consultant and meet with clients, become their advisor, stay there a while, and then when the job is done, move on to the next one.
MURIEL WILKINS: Alex has recently taken on a new role that has some aspects that get him energized, but at a lower level than he hoped for at this point in his career. He’s interested in understanding what he might do differently to break out of the career rut that he feels he’s in. I start the conversation by asking him what he thinks he needs to work on, including what feedback he’s received in the past about his leadership potential.
ALEX: I would say the biggest one has been my ability to self-advocate and be, I won’t say brag, but just be a little bit more conscious of making sure people know the value that I’m bringing to the table and putting that in front of the people that make the decisions, right. So complementary to that is networking and building relationships with the folks that can get me to that next level.
There may have been some feedback in the past, and I think I’ve tried to work on as best I can is as far as sort of executive presence and meetings, and I’ve taken classes and have tried to work on how I present myself in meetings and on conference calls and talking to others and trying to maintain that energy. So I know that’s a hard skill that I’ve tried to work on, but probably the biggest one has been who are you? What’s your brand? And then how do I get in front of the people that can get you to where you want to go?
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Okay, so let me just make sure I capture that right and playback the feedback that you’ve received in the past. So I sort of hear it in two different components.
One is your ability to advocate for yourself in a way that demonstrates your value and makes you visible to the right folks who can then think about you when it comes to these more senior positions or who can advocate on your behalf around those positions or think about you for certain projects, right, which is oftentimes what we call kind of having a sponsor.
So that’s one bucket, the advocacy piece, and then the second bucket, you put it under this executive presence thing-
ALEX: Regret.
MURIEL WILKINS: … in terms of meetings, and you’ve taken classes and tried to learn some of the skills all around that. And so when you hear this feedback, even as I play it back to you now, how does it resonate with you?
ALEX: The executive presence… I’ll take the second one first.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
ALEX: The executive presence does resonate with me in terms of consistency. I come across as very youthful a lot of times, and that can be mistaken for just being real informal sometimes, and I would say immature per se. That I do know about myself. And then I fight it sometimes because I know that everything I’ve done is… Executive presence is really… for me, the way I’ve interpret it is as being kind of… it’s a reflection of who you are in front of people. It’s really more of who you are.
So if I’m presenting myself and I feel pretty, I won’t say I’ll use the word authentic, but if I know what my strengths are, then when I am in front of people, I would amplify what those are. So, to me, that’s executive presence. And when I’m in a room, I feel like I don’t have a lot of issues, and folks recognizing me in a different way but also listening to me. I still know there’s some work from a consistency standpoint because there are times where I’m like, Oh.
I’ll be in a room, or I’ll be with a person, and I’ll be in that mode of like, Oh, I’m… I can see myself as a leader and having some kind of authority or being articulate in what I’m saying. But then it may drop off into something more informal where it’s like, Oh, I’m acting more like a kid when I probably should not be. So, for that, it’s more of a consistency thing. From the self-advocacy standpoint and personal brand, I think that’s a big one for me because, as a consultant, I’m like a jack of all trades and master of none.
And when you are like that, or you think that it’s really hard to pinpoint how do I describe what my brand is to people, when I feel like I can pick up any problem, figure it out, and help you get to a solution. I’m not a vertical guy. I’m like, Oh, I’m not expert in the consumer products and retail industry or an expert in healthcare, but I can do certain things. I just like to solve big problems, and I like to organize chaos, and that’s what I do. That’s kind of where I am. It’s like, do I need to hone that in, or does it matter of just finding the right person that understands where I’m coming from?
MURIEL WILKINS: So I appreciate you drilling down a little bit more because I think it’s important to sort of understand for yourself how you’re interpreting the feedback so that you can even decide, which I’m going to ask you, do you even want to address any of this feedback? And do you think it correlates with your question around, “Is there something holding me back from being in some of these longer-term senior positions?”
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So when you hear this feedback, and you’ve sort of interpreted in your own light because you don’t have to, are they areas that actually want to shine the light on and address?
ALEX: I do. Mainly the kind of what’s next. Am I even trying to solve the right problem, and is being an executive or a VP or C-level person something I really… is that something that I really want to do?
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: Hey Alex, what’s the kind of role that energizes you, and how can I articulate that to the folks that I continue to meet that either are going to be my sponsor or a future client someday? Directionally, I think that’s where I’m a little bit lost, right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. And so here’s interesting to me, Alex: In order for you to be able to even tell that story to someone of, “Hey, here’s what energizes me, and here’s what I bring to the table” so that then, as you said, they can spot you and sponsor you and do all the things, you have to be clearer about what that is.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. And that’s the difference. You can wait for somebody to just say, “Oh, this is what you bring to the table. Come on board.” And then you’re reacting to it. Or you can say, “No, I’m putting a stake in the ground. This is what it is, and it does feel aligned with my interests, my strengths, my experience, all the things,” in the way that you said, for example, where you finally were at that point where you said it just felt like it fit.
Okay, so I understand now that you’re saying, hey. But it comes in the question of what’s next. But I think in order to really be able to articulate what’s next in the way that you just defined, it would be worthwhile to take it back to this original question of what is the value that you bring to the table. Okay.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And let me just say that I think the two areas that you articulated in terms of feedback, this executive presence piece, and then this self-advocacy piece, which is defining the… what is the value you bring to the table are actually quite related.
ALEX: Oh, okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: Let me tell you how. When you think about executive presence, it really is grounded in two things. It’s grounded in how credible folks think you are and how relatable they think you are. Okay?
ALEX: [inaudible 00:11:31]. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So it’s not just, Am I being authentic? Authentic is important, but how are we defining authenticity here? Authenticity is the, Am I able to articulate what is authentic in terms of my strengths, in terms of what I bring to the table in terms of my value? Is my value contribution actually aligned with who I am?
It’s like it would be very of me, Muriel, to say, “The value that I bring to the table is I’m going to help you win the basketball game.” Okay. Completely inauthentic. Straight out lying actually. So that is not my value contribution. So that is the credibility aspect of it. And if you don’t know what it is that you’re bringing to the table, especially as the more senior you become, where it’s not defined for you, the more folks are going to be at a loss around where you actually fit.
ALEX: Yeah. That makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: And then the relatability aspect is then is the value that you bring to the table and the approach that you bring to the table does it resonate with the context and the stakeholders that you’re dealing with because everything is contextual?
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: My senses from what you’re sharing is you’ve experienced that.
ALEX: From a credibility standpoint, it’s figuring out, Okay, what am I credible in?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, what are you credible in?
ALEX: And that’s where I’ve been more of a chameleon, right. Because you put me in a situation, I figure it out, right. So-
MURIEL WILKINS: Uh-huh.
ALEX: … I think that’s… I think it’s now trying to understand what it is that I really want because usually, I just go and find problems to solve. But I’m at the point now where it’s like, maybe I can be more selective now that I have a lot of tools in my tool belt, figuring out which tool I want to actually use and sharpen.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Yeah. What I love is that when you said, “Yeah, what is my credibility?” I think that that is the question. And earlier, when you talked about that part of the challenge for you, is that as a consultant, you’re a jack of all trades, master of none, right.
ALEX: Mm-hmm. Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so tell me a little bit more about that. What is that? How do you relate that to the value that you bring to the table?
ALEX: Let me think about that one. So, as an example, I had a client that was in the middle of a merger, and they had a responsibility to go out to a lot of different locations to help bring all of these locations on onto the same, let’s say, the same technology platform. They weren’t quite sure how long it would take to do it, what they needed to do to do it, and what activities needed to occur.
So, they really needed sort of a roadmap and strategy for how that was to get done. I went in, they basically gave me the problem statement, and I organized and put together kind of, “Here’s the roadmap that you need. Here’s the time it can be done based on the people that you have, and here are the type of people that you need.” So, to me, the value I provided was giving them a clear line of sight for how this big… what seemed like this big monstrous project that needed to get done could get done.
And putting that on paper and making them see it and understand this is what it takes to get done because, otherwise, it would just stayed in the atmosphere in terms of ping-ponging discussions about, “Here’s what we need, here’s what we don’t need, this is why it’s not going to work, this is why it will work.” The value I bring is I bring that sort of logical structuring and thinking to big ambiguous problems to create clarity, right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So the value that you bring is you bring logical thinking to big problems to create clarity.
ALEX: [inaudible 00:15:53].
MURIEL WILKINS: So if I work with Alex, I’m going to go from chaos to clarity.
ALEX: That’s right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Okay. That, as a value proposition, how does it align with a senior leadership role?
ALEX: I would say this is where the disconnect is in my head, right. Because when I look at senior leadership roles, they’re responsible for a specific function unless there was a chief strategy or chief innovation or some kind of innovation leader where you just get some big hairy thing like, “Oh, go explore gen AI and how it can solve X and Y problem.” Unless there was something like that in an organization, I feel like that’s where something with my skill set or someone with my skill set would thrive.
But not a traditional like CFO or COO type of role where you’re keeping the lights on, but probably more of a chief strategy or chief development officer type of role. But even then, it’s still a disconnect for me because I like the execution part of it. So even though there’s a strategy portion, which I tend to like, I’m more a 20% strategy, 80% let’s get things done type of guy.
So that’s why I’ve always leaned towards, Oh, I should be looking at VP of operations or chief operating officer type of roles, because 80% of what they do is execution, and maybe there’s 20% where they’re thinking of the strategy for what should operations look like 5, 10 years, 15 years down the road.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. So you’re making it very clear that value proposition, which you actually have clarity around is not necessarily aligned… if I’m hearing you correctly, is not necessarily aligned with a traditional senior level role unless it had this specificity of strategy or operational strategy and execution and development transformation type of where there was an execution element to it as well.
And you started talking a little bit about, which was going to be my next question, how aligned is that value proposition with… Because you named it earlier, kind of authenticity, right.
ALEX: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: How aligned is it with your own interests and where you want to spend your time and where you see yourself and the skills that you bring to bear rather than what you think you should be doing?
ALEX: Yeah. I like to solve problems, and I also like to learn different things, right. So this part we haven’t talked about is I’m always… I’m intellectually curious. So that’s what makes problems to me exciting if they’re especially problems [inaudible 00:18:42] that I have no experience in.
So I like to be able to learn new things as I’m solving problems because I like to bring my perspective, but also, as I’m figuring that problem out, I immerse myself in the industry. I immerse myself in the processes. I immerse myself in understanding how… basically how money’s being made. Everything you need to know, I try to immerse myself in that business so that I do.
MURIEL WILKINS: While Alex began the conversation focused on executive presence, we’ve narrowed in on the question of his personal and professional brand. Alex feels like there’s still something he’s chasing in his career and has looked back to determine patterns and to identify potential gaps. It can be so easy to focus on what you don’t have when it comes to the checklist for leadership.
But I wanted to start with defining what he does have focusing on his strengths, and have him really spell those out. When taking stock of your career history, it can help to start by framing what value you do add, even if that is different from the skills you think you might need. Then, take a look at how your strengths align with your interests and opportunities.
And if something still doesn’t feel right, ask yourself where the disconnect might be. That’s what I explored next with Alex. So it feels like there’s actually quite close alignment between what you want for yourself and what you have defined as your value proposition. It feels like there’s not… there’s kind of midway alignment between what you bring to the table and what necessarily fits in that senior leadership bucket, right.
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so, where else do you think there might be a disconnect, if any?
ALEX: I think the disconnect is probably between what I think I want and what I really love doing. Does that make sense?
MURIEL WILKINS: That makes a lot of sense, but I think it makes a lot of sense. Tell me a little more.
ALEX: So some of the things I described also what I like are things that a business owner… a small business owner would go through, not necessarily that executive and a Fortune X company, but maybe even an executive in a company or just a small business, I won’t say executive, but let’s say a leader or small business owner or somebody that’s running a small business. So I learned a lot from all the experiences that I’ve had.
And when I was a leader in a small chemicals company, I found that I liked that because I was involved in every aspect of the operation. I wasn’t siloed in HR. I wasn’t siloed in customer service. I got to run and see and help make improvements or try to make improvements across all aspects of the organization. And I had the autonomy and authority to do that. Well, not authority. I would say I had the autonomy to make recommendations, but I liked being able to do that because there are problems in every single area that had improvement opportunities.
So that, to me, wasn’t off the table either. But that’s a different ask than just the traditional applying for a job online for an X-level position or using a headhunter. So it’s an avenue that I haven’t really explored, but I’ve always kind of had this, “Oh, well, maybe because of what I like doing and because I like every aspect a business and operations, and I like to solve big problems that are very ambiguous, small businesses are that.”
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: And so maybe that’s an avenue.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, so when you say, “What I think I want”—what is it that you think you want?
ALEX: I try to… Without giving you an absolute answer, I just… I want to do the things that energize me or have a job that energizes me, work with people I like, and be able to learn new things along the way. Try to become intelligent about something new while I’m doing it. So I know the characteristics. I think maybe my problem is I’ve been trying to identify what that nirvana is that is all those things.
And maybe that’s not because talking to you and thinking about articulating like, “Okay, what’s my brand?” It’s like, these are the things that I’m looking for in ideal job, and then put it out to universe or whoever my people are and say, “What kind of things do you think of when I describe this is what I’m looking for.”
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t know. That’s what you currently do, or that’s what you think you should do.
ALEX: No, that’s what I think I should do. That’s what I’m not doing. I’m doing that. I’m doing the traditional, throw my resume into the interweb sphere and see if it sticks.
MURIEL WILKINS: If it sticks. Yeah. Right.
ALEX: Yeah. And it hasn’t been sticking. So I think [inaudible 00:23:56]-
MURIEL WILKINS: And I’m going to add another element. And again, just tell me if I’m off here. Not only are you throwing out in the interwebs and hoping that it sticks, you’re also sort of crossing your fingers and hoping that it sticks with some senior-level leadership role.
ALEX: Yeah, you hit it. Nail on the head.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And the disconnect, I think… I’m using the word disconnect because it’s like, it’s not that there’s something wrong with what you are presenting as your value proposition.
It’s more is it a value proposition that fits in the puzzle piece of what a senior leadership role requires in a certain context, which is why I think you saw the difference like, Oh, maybe if it’s in a smaller company where all hands on deck you’ve got to roll up your sleeves, you have to be able to work in all different areas, then I can get all the things that I’m looking for, and they leverage my strengths.
But if I’m in a more scaled-up senior leadership role, there’s a bit of a disconnect. And what I hear the disconnect, Alex, is much of what you have described in terms of the strengths that you bring to bear and what you like to immerse yourself in is doing. It’s the execution. It is the rolling your sleeves up.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And again, depending on the scale, I mean, you say… this is not me making this up. Well, you read any leadership book, it’s like you’ve got to be able to kind of let go of the doing, right. You’re doing things through other people.
And you are… it’s not that you don’t do anything, but it is more of the strategic focus and leading and less on the day-to-day execution, digging into the problem, pulling it apart, learning it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that either. I think the question that is for you is, is what you are saying you want in terms of a senior leadership role actually what you want?
ALEX: As I was listening, I started to think a little bit about the doing part. And when I was part of a big firm, that was probably the thing that folks called out as my strength, being able to execute projects and not only being able to execute projects, but also being able to coach and manage my staff. So, as part of the big firm model and the structure, I was able to lead a team and manage a team. And that’s a part that I haven’t had in a very long time when… ever since I left because, again, I told you, I’ve been in a lot of individual contributor roles where I’ve been advisory more so than anything, but never really managed a team.
And that’s how I’ve ended up just kind of doubling down on doing, doing, doing and I’ve never been able to get out of that. So, I think your point is definitely eye-opening to me because that’s what I’ve done. As an individual contributor, it’s like I’ve always been, it’s either influencing to get things done, or I have to do it because I’ve never had a team, and that’s the one thing that I’ve missed ever since I left that environment.
But that also may be the thing that’s, to your point, it’s holding me back too, because if I describe my resume to you, that’s what it’s going to say since I left. It’s like, “Oh, you’ve been an individual contributor. All you’ve been doing is kind of doing, doing, doing for the clients and the executives that you worked with. So how’s that going to sell me that you’re ready to be a leader in our organization?” And that’s… I mean, you say disconnect, that’s one of the disconnect. That’s like a big… That’s Grand Canyon kind situation.
MURIEL WILKINS: Grand Canyon situation. I love it. Yeah. Right. And I think there’s two questions coming out of that because there’s nothing wrong with being an individual contributor. I know people who’ve been like, “Forget this management to VP to C-suite. I don’t want all… Let me be a career individual contributor.” And they forge their path to be that. And there are trade-offs.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: But they are willing to make the trade-off because they have identified that that’s what they want. And then there are others who say, “No, I want to be on that career track,” which is expanding responsibilities. Think about the sort of traditional leadership pipeline stuff where you go from individual contributor to managing others, to managing managers of others, to being an… a functional leader to an enterprise leader. There’s no shame in either game.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: But you are better off deciding which one you want to play so that you can align yourself in terms of experiences and positions in a way that supports that track.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: You know?
ALEX: Yeah, yeah. And if you circle back to the beginning of our conversation, as we started talking, I would say that I was more, right or wrong, in love with the shine of the recognition piece of going up the path that you just described because that’s a pretty fairly explainable piece of how your career progression and this is where I am and I’m this whatever, whatever in an organization, versus what I really am from a, “This is what I like to do and this is what energizes me.” So I think it’s more caught up in the, this is what I think my past should be, but everything that I’ve done doesn’t really align with that. It’s more, this is who I am. I’m a doer. You throw me in any situation, I’ll figure it out and get it done for you. End of story.
MURIEL WILKINS: End of story, right. End of story. Let me ask you a question, ALEX. If you only had to explain it to yourself, right. Let’s imagine that.
ALEX: Yeah, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: If you only had to explain your career story and where you are to yourself, what would that sound like? Because you just shared like, “Oh, it sounds very logical if I explain it to other that I follow this upward mobility career track, and I’m… it makes sense.” Okay.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: But if nobody was watching, and we don’t know if they are, but if nobody was watching, if you only had to explain it to yourself, what does the current career story sound like?
ALEX: If I had explained it to myself, I would say, “ALEX, you help business leaders get things done.” And that’s my only sentence, honestly. And if somebody wants to ask me about what that means and I can give examples. And then whether it sticks or not, then that’s kind of how it is.
But I can give a number of examples where I’ve helped organizations and I’ve helped leaders get from point A to point B successfully, and that’s pretty much it. I’m pretty simple like that. So that’s how I would describe it to myself, and I would hope myself understood that and asked the right questions to say more.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And so, what would hold you back from explaining it that way to others?
ALEX: Oh, man. That’s deep. The whole fear of judgment thing, I don’t know. I think… Yeah, I mean, that’s probably it. It’s like, oh, sometimes I feel like maybe that would not be enough for other people, but I feel like that’s my own issue because it should be enough for me. And I think that’s when I say it to myself. It’s enough for me because I know what that means to me.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: Right. And then just finding a way to articulate that to someone else. I mean, that’s something I could work on.
MURIEL WILKINS: We started this conversation with Alex questioning his executive presence. “How do I change the way I present myself to people to get to the executive level?” But in chipping away at that, he came to define not just his strengths as a leader but also what he actually enjoys doing. This is an important point for leaders across industries and stages of their career. There is more than one way to lead, more than one way to manage, and more than one way to be an executive.
The chasm between what seems like a good title or a good salary and what we actually want to be doing can be so wide for so many of us. And honestly, there is more likely to be a disconnect in those situations because there isn’t alignment between what we really want and what we think we should want for our career. Now that Alex has begun to define his personal brand, it’s time to think about what that means for him in terms of what’s next. Look, I am taking a deep breath as I say this, right. I think you’re at this crossroads.
The way that I’m experiencing you right now is I feel like you’re at this crossroads around what’s more important? “Is it how it feels and looks to me, or how it feels and looks to others, and what am I going to anchor myself around?” Okay, so that’s number one. I think number two is there’s a difference between being in this place of proving your worth, which I’m imagining you talked about the Grand Canyon, which I’ve never been by the way, but I can imagine what it’s like.
ALEX: You can imagine. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m imagining it being a climb of improving the worth, which is why you’re tired, versus the path of, I have worth. This is my worth. The worth is I help business leaders get from point A to point Z, right. I help business leaders go from chaos to clarity. I help business leaders get results, the results that they want. That is my worth. Would you like it, or would you not? Which is, tell me, when I give you both of those paths, what’s the difference between the two for you?
ALEX: The difference for me is I wish I could say it like you said it because I feel like I would’ve a lot more confidence when I say it. But the second one feels more me, and it’s not something that leaves me with a, Oh, I have to figure out what to say about that, like why I’m saying it. Whereas the first path of the should path, I’ll call it, I feel like I have to do a lot more thinking of why I have to justify that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: But saying that, I’m the person that helps business leaders get from A to Z. If you give me a problem, throw it at me, and I’ll figure it out for you that I have a high level of confidence, and because I’ve done it before, and that to me feels more… that feels more authentic, and I can build off of that. I know I have a litany of experiences I can do to back that up. Whereas the other, the Grand Canyon version, that one, yeah, that takes a lot of dancing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Takes a lot of dancing, right.
ALEX: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: You’re tired of dancing.
ALEX: I am.
MURIEL WILKINS: If we go back to the definition of executive presence, and one part of the equation is the credibility piece, what I’m hearing you say is when you go with the version of, “I help business leaders get results,” and you said you can say it with confidence because you’ve done it it’s because it’s credible not only before you make it credible to others, it’s credible to you.
You have conviction around it. And what does credible mean? It’s a belief in it. So you believe in yourself around this value. The dancing part, the Grand Canyon part is when you are putting it out there that you can deliver on something, but you actually aren’t sure if you can. You don’t have conviction. You aren’t quite yet in a place where you believe that you want to. So never mind the skill. Do you even want to?
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s very hard to be seen by others as credible in anything if we don’t believe that we are that. It can happen for a little bit, right. They give you hope.
ALEX: I’ve been living on hope.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. But over the long haul, you’ve got to… that’s the self-conviction. That’s what self-confidence is. And so, from that standpoint, so how does what we’ve just talked about inform you in terms of some of the initial question you came with, which is, “What is holding me back from being seen in these longer-term senior leadership roles?”
ALEX: Yeah, it’s helped me get clear on the statements to start out with, I would say. So I think I’ve had this limiting belief where saying, “Oh, I help business leaders get things done,” I had this limiting belief that’s not enough, because easy to say, “Oh, I’m a…” I use healthcare, for example. “I’m a neurosurgeon. I’m an orthopedic surgeon.” People know exactly what you do.
But for me to say, “Oh, I help business leaders get things done,” it’s like, “Okay, let’s say more.” And I felt like I should have a statement where people would know exactly what you do and what you’re about, but then I think I am talking to you, I’m going to let that go because it is enough to say that because I can say more about it without having to do more work to think about why it is the way it is, right.
I think that’s what I’ve been stuck in to say, “Oh, what do you do? What do you do, ALEX? You’re a management consultant. What is that?” I was like, “Well, let me describe this to you.” But now I can say with confidence that I help executives really get their most strategic projects done.
MURIEL WILKINS: And as a result of that?
ALEX: As a result of that… I’m drawing a blank. As a result of that, I’m feeling wise. It’s enough. It’s enough for me. It grounds me in something to build off of as I start to put pen to paper, and depending on the audience that I’m talking to.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s amazing. I think you have the starting piece. What I would encourage you to do as a next step is kind of think about those different audiences where you have to potentially answer that question, or even better yet, not answer the question. Just start with that because now we get into the field of the self-advocating, right.
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: The self-advocating is actually just voicing what it is that you do or who you are. Okay. And the way that you then make it relevant for the other. It’s not about being chameleon-like, it’s making it relevant. The value that you bring to the table is driving to the so what for them? Why is that important to them? What’s the implication?
If you were talking to me and you say, “I help business get results,” and you want to drive the implication for me, it could be, “I help executives like you, Muriel, get to results. And guess what? I make them sleep better at night because they don’t have to worry about all the management of their teams, et cetera.” And I do like, “Oh my gosh, what? Give me your number.” But for somebody else, it might be something different.
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It doesn’t change the value that you bring. It’s the relevancy that you then have to figure out how do you make your value relevant to others. And for some, it will be, and for some, it won’t, and that’s okay.
ALEX: No, that makes complete sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ALEX: And I like the relevancy piece because I do think that’s where I need some work. How’s what I bring to the table relevant to the issues or problems that you, senior leader, are trying to solve?
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. And how do you think you can figure that out?
ALEX: I think it comes with, if I start with kind of this is who I am, and this is my brand statement, if you will, I think it naturally starts a conversation with the whoever I’m talking to that lends them to describe kind of what their problems are.
And then from a relevancy standpoint, being able to pull from my experiences to tell a story or tell a past experience I had that applies to that particular issue or problem they’re trying to solve. But if I would just say that to you without knowing about your business and the issues that you have, I’d just be taking a shot in the dark. So it’s going to require a little bit of work to figure that out.
MURIEL WILKINS: Sure. I mean, you might be, and I will offer, Alex, that you have a lot of experience. So, over your years of experience, I suspect that there’s some pattern recognition of what some of the common problems are, right. We all think we’re special and we are the only ones to have the same business problem. But you probably are like, “Mmm, you’re not that special. Here are the four or five that I see.”
And so, yes, there’s one approach which is, Let me not shoot in the dark and let me hear what their problems are. And then say, “Oh, by the… Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s where I can help.” Another approach to put in your arsenal, to put in your range, is to say, “I help business leaders do XYZ, and here’s how I’ve seen this play out. I’ve been able to get them, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Now react. Do you resonate with any of those problems? What problems are you facing?” And I think that’s the self-advocacy piece. It’s being able to tell your story without fear of, Ooh, it’s I’m going to miss.
ALEX: Yeah, that’s good as well. That also speaks to that kind of being viewed as that authority or leader, just being more proactive in the demonstrating [inaudible 00:42:53] my relevance rather than waiting.
MURIEL WILKINS: Rather than waiting.
ALEX: Then it goes back into doing again, right. It’s like, “Oh, you’re just waiting for the order to just do things,” and I’m trying to get out of that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly. So it’s both. It’s doing both. It’s not one or the other. It’s not swinging the pendulum from one side. Like, I’m not going to say anything. I’m not going to say anything to the other side. Well, let me just tell you exactly what your problem is. Right?
ALEX: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s figuring out but always being ready with, “Yeah, here’s my story.” Because you do have a story, and you do have value, and as you’ve put it is good enough, right.
ALEX: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: There is worthiness there.
ALEX: Yeah. I think that’s… it’s really helped me to understand what I’m describing is good enough and that I can use it to be kind of my own advocate and have more confidence in talking to whatever the audience is or whoever it is.
And have to be okay with, Hey, it may be good enough for this person, but it may not be good enough for that person. Because it has been. And honestly, it’s I have been able to find roles where that has been good enough. I may not have articulated in that way, but I know that I can do it. So I know it’s out there, so I appreciate that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. But if you’re not able to articulate it, you’ll never… you won’t ever know what the reason it was. Okay. All right.
ALEX: [inaudible 00:44:11]. All right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, so tell me how you feel now versus how we started the conversation.
ALEX: Honestly, I feel a lot clearer. At the beginning, I was all over the place, but now I have a definite path that I’m confident in, and it’s bringing it all together and just being able to kind of hone those value proposition statements. And then even test it out on the folks that I’m around and use it in my current environment as well as outside of it as I try to explore how this sticks in the marketplace.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right.
ALEX: Right. And it helps me also… It also helps me be okay with where I am because now I have the luxury of being in a position where now I have the time to really focus on that and get it even more clear for the next… the rest of my career because I really don’t want to stop consulting. People have this idea of retirement, but I can provide advice all day long. So [inaudible 00:45:19] as long as my brain works, I’m good.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yep. Yep. And listen, being okay is priceless.
ALEX: Yeah. No.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m glad you’re there.
ALEX: I’m glad you’re helping me get there.
MURIEL WILKINS: Good. Well, thank you, Alex. I appreciate it.
ALEX: Yeah. Same.
MURIEL WILKINS: As an executive coach, leadership presence is a topic that comes up a lot and is vital for those looking to advance professionally. As I said, leadership presence really breaks down to two essential elements, credibility and relatability. In the case of Alex, being able to define what makes him credible and relatable helped him in more than just understanding how he was presenting himself.
It opened the door to a larger conversation about what he really wants, what goal he’s really aiming for, and what his brand is and could be. The unblock for Alex was valuing his own brand. Without that, there is no way he can communicate and demonstrate it with conviction and confidence. Only when you take hold of your own leadership story can you truly be an effective advocate for yourself and your career. That’s it for this episode of Coaching Real Leaders. Next time.
SPEAKER 3: I was firing all cylinders, and I had these great superpowers and getting great recognition, and I don’t feel like I have those superpowers anymore, and I am wondering if this is a horrible thing to say, but am I past my peak? Did I expend all my superpowers? Am I just done?

Episode 3: How Do I Lead When I Don’t Feel Like I Belong at the Table?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders, part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
Today’s guest is someone we’ll call John to protect his confidentiality. He previously worked as a management consultant advancing at his firm, and then moved into an in-house strategy role at a company several years ago. That move was so that he could eventually transition from advisory to a more senior operational leadership role.
JOHN: I guess, long-term dot on the horizon is to have a managing director type role, either of a business unit in a bigger company or for lack, a smaller mid-cap company. So, using the broad skill sets I built early on of knowing a little bit about everything in that CEO type position where I need to know a little bit about all the departments and then bring cohesion and a way forward to all of them.
MURIEL WILKINS: So far, his hope for advancement hasn’t panned out quite as he had hoped.
JOHN: I figured I would get into a manager or role, which I did, and then find where in the company I would shoot some roots and where my skills matter the most and then pick up a topic to progress and own. I’m still the PowerPoint builder doing research and presenting it to management and it’s not like I have any kind of operational responsibility, so nothing in the company stops if I were to go on leave. It’s just that some research will not get done and perhaps some decisions are postponed. My ambition around grabbing a topic that I can own and progress that the opportunities to do. So, I’ve just been few and far between.
MURIEL WILKINS: John wants to figure out how to get the leadership role he wants and thinks there are some key communication issues getting in his way.
JOHN: I’ve become more mature in my career and recently I’ve noticed a shift in what’s expected of me and more of my work involves this high-level strategic discussions, especially these unstructured free form meetings with senior stakeholders where there’s a back and forth between participants while I thrive in the sessions that I’m used to where I prepare deeply and where I lead the conversation as a consultant or somebody who’s presenting a topic. Now, I often find myself in these more fluent meetings and I find myself holding back in them. My natural style is to listen first to others and then speak. And in these meetings often others will contribute more quickly and I then start to second guess myself and what I want to contribute and meanwhile the conversation moves away from me and I leave the room feeling I wasn’t present or impactful.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: I guess, I had these conversations always because I always was in this consultant’s role and we need to see what can we do for our client and what problems are they facing and sometimes I’m better at it, sometimes I’m worse. But I feel if I can break the types of meetings that I have down in two sections, one is these kinds of free form meetings and the other is I prepare and I present and we talk. The free form meetings are starting to take up a much greater percentage of my time, starting maybe in the beginning of my career, 10% moving now more to 60 or 70. So, I feel like my skills have needed to change and I’m insecure about whether I’m doing a good job and I feel like it’s holding me back.
MURIEL WILKINS: You feel like it’s holding you back. Holding you back from what?
JOHN: Being recognized as kind of the leader that would take on a managing director role when it does become available.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, got it. All right, so let me just make sure I fully understand. So, in terms of the interactions that you have, and this is primarily with senior leaders?
JOHN: Yes. It’s easier for me with peers or somewhere else in your organization, but when it comes down to C-suite or boards, the insecurity will come out a little bit more.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, got it. So, you feel confident or you feel secure to use your term when it’s the format of you come in, you present, you share, and then there’s a discussion or they ask questions, but it’s a more structured discussion. And where you’re feeling more insecure, again to use your term, is when it’s more of a free form conversation in terms of there’s not as much structure to it, right? It’s a back and forth and you tend to listen first, but then others jump in and-
JOHN: Yes, and I will start this internal loop of second guessing and deciding when to speak or what to say, and then I end up either saying nothing, or worse, saying something I’m not very proud of.
MURIEL WILKINS: Understood. So, you mentioned it’s holding you back from being recognized as somebody who could take on a more senior role, which is what your aspiration is. Have you gotten any input that that is the case? Do you have a sense of how you are perceived in those meetings beyond your own self-perception?
JOHN: So, I have got zero feedback to confirm what I’m feeling here.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: Sometimes, I know it’s purely in my own head and I can try to rationalize it away, and sometimes I can, but there’s still this feeling of insecurity that will linger.
MURIEL WILKINS: We’re going to jump really quick to one of your to-dos.
JOHN: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: Because I think it’s important that there’s two levels of experience. There is when you are in any situation, one is how are others experiencing you in that situation or in your case, in these conversations, in these meetings. And then the second piece just as important is how are you experiencing yourself. And it’s the ability to ask those questions, not in a vacuum, but when you have answers to both those questions, then the next step is that answer, is that aligned with how I want to be experienced or the impact that I want to make? And so, we’re going to drill down on your own experience of yourself. I do think it would be valuable that you seek out some information around how others are experiencing you to see what the alignment is there. All right?
And that is as simple as the next time you have one of these meetings, pick two or three people who are going to be in there, even one person is better than none and say, “Hey, in this meeting can you observe how I participate, how I communicate?” Be very specific about what you’re looking for. “How I engage? Because I’m going to come to you afterwards and ask you, how did you experience me in that meeting?” So, be very specific. Don’t just wait until after the meeting and say, “Hey, can you give me feedback on how I did?” Because people will just either say, well, if they’re really good at giving feedback, they’ll be specific. But 99% of the time people will be like, “Oh, you did fine.” And that’s not helpful.
JOHN: Yeah, exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: No.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, that’s your first homework. But let’s now drill down on the path of how you experience yourself. Okay? So, I want you to walk me through, and maybe you want to think about, without getting into the specifics of the details of the content of the meeting, but I want you to envision a meeting that you had in the recent past that reflects what you’re sharing here where you’re feeling like you’re not engaging the way you would like, you’re experiencing the second-guessing of yourself. So, I want you to envision a particular meeting. Think of a very specific one that you went through. Do you have one that you’re thinking of?
JOHN: Yeah, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. If we had recorded that meeting and we were to play it back now, what would I see?
JOHN: So, you would see a quick back and forth during the meeting between some of our more senior colleagues and me being quiet for the majority of it, but listening very intensively. And what’s going on in my head is I will think about what if what I say is wrong? What if I mess up their flow of communication or I’ll have something really specific to say or to contribute, but while thinking about this, they will have already moved on. And the meeting ended basically with me still trying to say my bit, but to me it felt like by now it was off-topic, too late, and then the meeting ended.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: And this is a worst-case example for me. Sometimes they look a little bit different, but that’s-
MURIEL WILKINS: A little bit different.
JOHN: What it could look like.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. That’s worst case.
JOHN: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: Have you had an experience when it’s these free form meetings, not the presentation type, but the free form meetings where it’s actually been best case where you’ve walked out and you’re like, “Oh, that one went well.”
JOHN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so, walk me through in the same way. What did you experience in those?
JOHN: I guess, I’m comfortable with my surroundings and I contribute to the conversation naturally. I feel like I’m a part of the conversation both in being addressed by whatever anyone else is saying and by having the time to speak without feeling like I have to interject before somebody else. I’ve had a few of these and I’ll have these regularly. The meetings where it matters more with our CEO or perhaps our COO, the more senior stuff, I feel like there is more of the bad case or even worst case there.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s interesting to me is when I asked you to lay out both scenarios for the first one, which was the, we’ll call it the worst case or bad case, I hate calling things bad, but you get what I’m saying. When I asked you to share with me what I would see or what happened in that meeting, you went quite quickly to what you were telling yourself, right? And you said it as I think some of the things you said is “What if what I say is wrong? What if I mess up the flow of the conversation?” So, there were questions that you ask yourself.
When we jumped to the best case, you didn’t share at all with me what your internal dialogue is. You shared with me what your actions are and how you feel, right? So, you said, “I feel comfortable. I’m actually contributing naturally. I have time to speak and I do speak up. It doesn’t feel like I’m interjecting.” So, for those you went straight from, you bypassed what you’re thinking and went straight to here’s how I feel [inaudible 00:11:15]. For the first one, you started with and described it in terms of what you’re thinking. Okay? So, what I’m interested in, what this made me curious about is, well, in those best-case scenarios, what are you thinking?
JOHN: What I’m not thinking about is when to say something, that’s the frustrating bit about these bad case scenarios is I have something to contribute but I am not contributing because I am asking myself these questions. In the good case scenario, those questions are just not there.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, what is there? Because there is a thought. It’s not like your brain went out the window. In your mind there is, and I’m digging here and I know you’ve probably never, to sound redundant, never thought about it. There is some thought pattern or belief or assumption that you’re making. We establish what the assumptions are for the worst-case scenario. They are the assumption of, “If I say something wrong, something’s going to happen. If I mess up the flow, something’s going to happen.” Those are the assumptions and worst-case scenario. What are the assumptions that you’re making in the best-case scenarios that then allow you to feel comfortable and allow you to speak?
JOHN: The assumption is I belong here and who is with me here values what I have to say and will listen and also give me the time to say it. I guess, I struggle with interjecting when the room is busy. My style is more to let the conversation play out a little bit. I would love to hear what you have to say and what you have to say, and then I’ll think about what I would like to contribute and I will share it, but I feel like the role that I’m in as the more junior member of the group with these C-suite people or more senior than that. The role that I’m in is to actually share my insights, so to get them thinking about the problems that they have.
I’ve been doing the groundwork and research, I’ve been talking to some of our other colleagues or I’ve been talking to customers or looking at the data and that part of my feeling I think stems from the feeling that I need to be quick on the spot always because that’s my role in this conversation and that adds some of the pressure that I feel around, also needing to quickly interject before it’s them that take over the conversation and I would not be able to, why I won’t get a chance to share my thoughts here.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m just curious, have you ever tried to get your idea out quicker than what is naturally your inclination or your preference?
JOHN: I’m sure I have. I don’t remember me ever trying, but I’m sure I have and it’s not like I do and then the house burns down. The conversation ebbs and flows the way it always does.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, nothing seems to happen on the outside. It’s not like everyone turns around and says, “Oh my God, John, why are you talking?
JOHN: No, exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: The conversation doesn’t just stop and all eyes on you and it’s not like they’re saying, “Who is this person? Why is he here?”
JOHN: Exactly. That’s what the worry is. But I know that will never happen and that’s also part of what makes me sometimes slap myself on the head thinking, “Why are you feeling this way?” Because it’s nonsensical and I can easily rationalize it away, but the feeling will linger. And while I’m thinking, “This doesn’t make sense. That will never happen. Just contribute to the conversation.” That will happen during the meeting and that means I’m not being present and the conversation will get away from me.
MURIEL WILKINS: John came into this coaching conversation with a very specific concern, how he shows up in meetings with more senior leaders, those higher-level discussions where he feels he isn’t contributing quickly enough, adding value or making the right impression. Sometimes what holds us back isn’t the situation itself, but what we think about it. In John’s case, worrying so much about saying the wrong thing, that it keeps him from saying anything at all. That’s why it’s important to come back to what’s actually happening. I often invite clients to play it out. Is there real evidence that speaking up would have a negative impact? It also helps to check how others are experiencing you instead of assuming the worst.
Anchoring in what’s real rather than what could go wrong is often the first step in working through any crisis of confidence. But what’s becoming clear is that this isn’t just about whether John can speak up, it’s about the assumptions he’s making about these senior level situations and himself. Let’s jump back into the conversation as we start to unpack those.
When you do feel in those environments comfortable speaking up and you do surface your opinion or your perspective in a more accelerated way, the thought going through your head or what you believe in that moment is, “I belong here.” Let’s just start with that one. Okay, I belong here. And what was interesting to me is you said, “I belong here. Whose here values what I have to say and who is here will give me the time.” You stated all of those as assertions rather than again, when you were in the worst case, you stated all of those as questions, which is no wonder to me why when you’re in the worst-case scenarios, you’re feeling self-doubt because you’re questioning yourself.
So, we’ve been using the word assumptions. They’re all assumptions. You are a consultant. I was a consultant back in the day. I was a strategy consultant, so I understand your world and I used to work the heck out of a spreadsheet model. And if there’s one thing I knew is if you had garbage assumptions going in, it didn’t matter how beautiful the model was pivot tables and everything,
JOHN: Garbage in, garbage out.
MURIEL WILKINS: It would be garbage out on the other side. And the beauty about assumptions is they are, I don’t know, what do you think assumptions are?
JOHN: Well, they’re there to be challenged and I guess I need to do that if I would ever want to move away from this.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean assumptions are, they’re assumptions. You can pick and choose your assumptions, you know what I mean? You create a budget for next year or even the strategy. You’re a strategy guy. We’re making assumptions up all the time. They can be informed, they can be grounded. But at the end of the day you could say, “Hey, we can pick assumption one or assumption two. Which one are we going to go with?” And then, that drives the strategy.
JOHN: Yes. I think one personality aspect of me that feeds into these insecurities, this perfectionism where I’m sometimes afraid to go with assumption A or B, more in the interpersonal relationships area. If it’s about my spreadsheet or my PowerPoints, and it’s easier to pick because you can rationalize all of it, but when social interaction comes into play, I guess, I struggle to pick a direction sometimes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, and I appreciate you being candid with that. One thing I want to differentiate with you is when you think about personality, how do you think about that for yourself? Your personality, is it just the way you are or how are you defining personality?
JOHN: Well, I believe and I strive for my personality to change with time because I learn and I experience and it’s a tricky question to answer. I don’t really know how to describe my personality. I mean, I know I have some bad habits and I know I have some character traits that don’t always help me, this being one of them, and I don’t see myself as being stationary, but I would also in these meetings that I’m in, not like to not be myself. I wouldn’t like to portray this image of who I think I need to be just to perform better. I would like to change who I am and therefore do well. I wouldn’t like to try to do well while not being who I am.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Okay.
JOHN: Does that make sense?
MURIEL WILKINS: It makes a ton of sense.
JOHN: So, I’m really looking inward and seeing where’s this feeling coming from and how can I not only rationalize it away, but actually emotionally put it aside and just be who I am, be authentic, and still get the impacts that I would like to have.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Yeah, I understand and I appreciate you being introspective around it. I’m going to invite you to think about this or approach it a little bit differently. This is nuanced in a thin line and can feel like semantics, but I just want you to come along with me for a little bit. We’ll play around with it. So rather than think about it or approach it from the perspective of I don’t want to change who I am as well as the, I want to be able to put the feeling aside, which means basically replacing it or moving away from it, letting go of a particular feeling. I’m inviting you to think about it, not so much around changing who you are, but increasing your range, increasing your capacity.
And when I say increase in capacity, I mean you mentioned that you have younger kids. If you think about when they’re really, really young, when they start feeding themselves, they can feed themselves with their hands. They’re picking up little finger food. Then eventually they start being able to use a spoon, so they’ve increased their capacity. Now they can use their fingers and a spoon. Then they start using a fork and they want to poke everything with a fork, and now, oh my gosh, now they have three things they can pick for me. Oh, my goodness. At some point they realized they can cut food. So now, they’re still eating, but they have all four of those tools at their disposal to be able to meet the goal of getting food into their mouth and they start learning which one best serves me in different situations. Right?
They start learning. If I’m eating soup, I’m going to use the spoon or I’m going to drink it out of the bowl. I’m not going to use the fork or the knife. They start making discernment, but they don’t abandon one for the other. Let’s think about the fact that the approach that you have brought to this. And when I say approach, I’m not just thinking about what you’re doing in these meetings, I’m talking about the assumption, the feeling, and then the action that follows has all been one of those utensils. What I want to invite you to do is say, “Are there different approaches you can take that don’t mean that they’re different than who you are?” They’re just an increased capacity that gives you more range and choice all still living within who you are.
JOHN: That makes a lot of sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, when I provide you with that invitation, what other approach do you think you could take in these meetings that would enable you just with the goal of speaking up sooner than what you do? Just that goal in and of itself. Let’s start with the assumption, then we’ll go to the feeling then the action. What different assumption would you need to make that would lead you to speaking up sooner in those meetings, these senior level meetings?
JOHN: So, if I were to attack the assumption that I’m making that others believe I don’t belong in the roof, I think we need to turn that on its head and realize that I do belong there because they’ve invited me. I think just reminding myself of that might help me to be more comfortable sitting down and contributing meaningfully later on.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Okay. So, let’s just drill down that one a little bit. Okay. I want to make it full proof. I love the fact that you said, “Yeah, I belong there because they asked me to be here.” It’s even different if you, because sometimes I show up at things and I’m like, “Yeah, maybe I don’t belong here because nobody asked me to show up, but I’m here.” And even then, right? So, they invited you to be at the meeting, you got the calendar invite, you showed up, therefore you belong. What else would you need to believe to make you believe that you belong in that meeting? And we’ll keep it really basic. What else would you need to believe?
JOHN: Yeah. Well, what I need to believe is that I’ve earned my seat and can contribute value just like any of the other participants, but it’s believing that that is sometimes the issue. When it’s a scheduled meeting and I can prepare, perhaps I can be a bit more thoughtful of preparing and getting into the right mindset, but you know that these meetings don’t always happen. Well, like you just said, with a calendar invite, sometimes they’re at the coffee table or after work, during dinner, which might be trickier if I choose to not really prepare these meetings. I find it hard to tell myself how to believe. I know what to believe, but how do I believe it?
MURIEL WILKINS: How do you believe anything?
JOHN: I need to see proof. Maybe I need some type of cookie jar with the positive or good case scenarios I’ve been to tell myself that’s how it can go. Second guessing yourself, this will only just make you not present and that’s not bad or good, that’s just you’re not there.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. It’s so interesting to me, right? Because in a way, you’re looking for a confirmation of your belief before it even happens, right?
JOHN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And I’m going to tell you, so again, I keep going back to the fact that you have little kids. What do little kids need to believe something?
JOHN: Pat on the back and tell them, “Good job.”
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Eventually and sometimes not even that, they just do. And so, I’m not trying to be glib here. What I’m suggesting is I said a couple of minutes ago I started off and then I cut myself off. I said, “The beauty about assumptions are…” Right? The beauty about beliefs is they’re malleable. You can choose what to believe in. It’s a hypothesis. And maybe you’re familiar with the term that I’m about to use, but I remember when I was in strategy consulting, we would talk about approaching a problem in two ways. One was a hypothesis driven approach and the other was the data driven approach. Are you familiar with those two?
JOHN: I guess, not the second one.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: Well, I know I have a hypothesis that I haven’t validated with data. That’s the whole problem here. I need to get out of my own head.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, no, I actually think, look, I mean people say that all the time, “Get out of your own head.” I don’t know how that’s possible. Your head is attached to your body, so you better make friends with it and you better get it aligned with what it is that you actually want to have happen. So, I think this is a case of you got to choose a different hypothesis. And the thing with a hypothesis is they’re exactly that. They’re hypotheses. You can change them. I remember back in science, it’s like, “What’s your hypothesis?” “Oh, this is it. Okay, let’s prove whether it bears out or not.” And what’s happening with you is you’re going in with a hypothesis of I don’t belong and it’s not aligned with the conclusion that you want, which is to show up as confident and so you have a choice, okay?
The choices, you either choose the assumption going in and then say, “Okay, if I know what I want to do is end up as more confident being able to speak up, what does my hypothesis need to be going in and let me align myself with that.” Or you go the data-driven method, which is what I feel like you are doing. The data-driven is let me look at all the data and let me see what it tells me. And then based on what it tells me, then I’m going to fall in line with that. And so, you’re waiting to see the data to tell you that you belong, to tell you that what you have to add in that room is valuable, but you’re not going to see that data because you’re not putting things on the table to give you the pat on the back that you want.
JOHN: No, exactly. That’s a great way to put it. And I would be totally okay with the data. If I would contribute to the meeting and feedback my manager gives me would be, “Hey, you’re off-topic or you need to improve XYZ.” I’ll be happy with that feedback because then I can learn and improve and I can try to go toward the level of impact that I would like to have. But now, I don’t even give people the opportunity to get me that feedback because whenever it does happen, silence and being stuck in your head means that people won’t hear or know even about the stuff that’s going on.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, I think you can parallel path, right? So, we talked earlier in our conversation about you trying to get some feedback from people. But I also want to focus on what’s in your control and as you said, like how do you move past some of the assumptions that you currently have, and you used the term earlier around changing them or putting them to the side. If we go back to this thing of increasing your capacity, and one of the things that you said as we were working through this is, “I can pick up the assumption of I do belong here.” Part of it is because you’re invited. I would also say wherever you physically are, you belong, like you’re there. So why is it even a question, right? You are there. There’s a difference between belonging someplace and being accepted. We haven’t gotten to the accepted part, but you’re there.
JOHN: Yeah, they gave me a job. They’re paying me a salary-
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
JOHN: And I have a list of responsibilities.
MURIEL WILKINS: For the time being, until somebody kicks you out or you choose to leave, you belong. Okay? You also talked about to make you feel that you belong, you have to believe that you’re adding value, which is a different assumption. Now, we get into the assumption of what is the value that you’re bringing to the table. And so, I want to test that one out a little bit. So, what would you have to believe about the value that you bring to the table to make you feel like you can move to contributing earlier than you typically do? And let me caveat it before you answer it. I want you to think about your response based on what is in your control, so not based on how other people would respond, not what other people would have to believe about your value. What would you have to believe about the value you bring to the table?
JOHN: Well, I am the company’s fact book in a way, and my team’s job is to establish facts based on hypothesis so that we can lay out the options and move forward as a company. And what I would need to believe for me to know that I add value is to have a conversation about what have we done here? What are the assumptions that have gone into our work? Could it also go completely this way and can we go off on a tangent about this random topic that was part of our conversation? I guess, what I need to believe about my value is can I answer the questions that are put in front of me or when I can’t, that’s also okay. Can I then have a free-form discussion with someone around what may need to happen or what might’ve happened? I find this one very tricky to answer, and I know I’m dancing around what the answer should be. The question is what do I need to believe to know that I add value?
MURIEL WILKINS: Let me simplify it a little bit. Maybe I use too many words there. I genuinely want know, what is the value you bring? Why are you in those meetings?
JOHN: Ultimately, the company needs to grow revenue, make a profit, and I’m part of the team that suggests projects to make that happen either by introducing new things or taking away all things. If those things happen, I think I’m doing a great job, but I think that’s more of an external reason that I can’t impact this. The company hasn’t been doing too well and I can propose business case after business case, and if there’s no money to execute them, they won’t happen. And that can contribute to me feeling not valuable because what I’m doing here is suggesting change, but change is not happening. That’s not really internal to me. It does contribute in my head to this feeling of not bringing enough value to the table.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I think you hit on something really important here. You’re measuring your success, right? If we look at you bringing value as success in those meetings, you’re measuring your value on something that is currently out of your control.
JOHN: Yes, that’s true. Yeah, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: That is, I don’t know about you, that’s causing me anxiety.
JOHN: I know, and it sounds horrible.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s not horrible. I think it’s you’re placing an expectation on yourself on something that you actually don’t have the capacity to do. I can sit here and honestly say, “Yeah, you do not have the power in your capacity to change the trajectory of the company.”
JOHN: I don’t believe that myself either.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
JOHN: But my feeling of value does depend on can we finally get one of these projects going beyond the pre-study phase or beyond the pilot phase? If not, then all I’m doing here is contributing to this stack of knowledge which is valuable in itself and maybe will get used when times are a bit better, which is also valuable. Part of my view of value or a significant chunk of my feeling or value does depend on does my work have impact?
MURIEL WILKINS: Does your work have impact? So, I think John, to me, I don’t have the answer. I often don’t have the answers. But what’s coming up for me is a question around would it be worthwhile to redefine what impact means, and here’s why that’s coming up for me. You started off when you were describing your role to me. You were saying that your responsibility is to shape the strategic discussions that happens at the senior levels. What you did not say is that your role is to make sure that one of these freaking projects gets done and implemented. What I heard was you are there to provide information and framing and input so that these individuals can then make the right strategic and investment decisions for the company.
JOHN: Yes. I see where you’re going with that. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m not going anywhere. I’m just playing back what you told me. Fast forward to now, what I’m hearing you say is, “When John thinks about his value, it equals that a project gets pushed through,” and that’s not really aligned with what your role is.
JOHN: No. That’s very true.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, what’s coming up for you?
JOHN: I have said that my role is to shape discussion and what I’m saying that my definition of value is that positive decisions are made regarding the projects I suggest, but that’s not shaping a discussion, that’s making a decision and a very particular decision, maybe not even the right decision. If we go back to the beginning where you asked me why did you move from being a consultant to working for just one company, part of it was having operational responsibility and more impact. Perhaps some of my feeling of the value that I’m currently not having is that I’m still that consultant that will paper push a project out and without any impact on whether it gets done or not. So perhaps, my sense of value contribution has changed from when I began as a consultant and was really excited about these things to a more mature version of myself and actually want to do rather than advise.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, what I hear you saying is there may be some dissonance between the value of the role that you’re in and the value that you want to create.
JOHN: Yeah, exactly. I can be completely happy with the role I have and there’s so many fun things about it, but I guess it’s just a frustrating role to be in when you’re not seeing the impact of your work, and I think that’s feeding some of my other insecurities around, “Do I really belong here?”
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I think there’s some nuance here because to me what I’m hearing is there is value in the role. The question is, do you still see value in the role? That’s number one.
JOHN: Yeah, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And number two, is that the impact that you want to be making? And number three, if it’s not the impact you want to be making, can you even make the impact that you want to make, the value that you want to create in the role that you’re in?
JOHN: Well, to answer that question, I think I can. It’s just that maybe times just need to be better. I think there’s some external factors at play regarding market, but I think this is a role I can really thrive in. I am a jack of all trades. I think I can have impact, the impact that I’m looking forward to. It’s not like all the time right now. It’s not like nothing is happening, but it’s frustrating when you do another one of these studies, suggest them and then move on to the next level. Do another hard push with a big team on getting facts out onto the table and then you move on to the next one and you do it again. And I know that’s feeling less valuable perhaps makes sense when that happens.
MURIEL WILKINS: It does, depending on how you’re defining value. That’s all we’re talking about here. Because I think, again, if you go back to if the metric is getting these projects through, then yes, it’s going to feel like you’re not adding value, which is different than I get the frustration you put in all the work. Here’s another one that gets denied. So, it can feel like, “Why do we put in all the work?” The flip side of that again is these folks need to make informed decisions. They made a decision. You know what I would say my metric would be my suggestion around a metric, around what would feel like, “Huh, something’s not clicking.” If these senior level folks were not able to make decisions at all based on what you were contributing.
JOHN: Yeah, that makes sense. And they find, well, me and my team are doing valuable. They keep us around even when the company needs to downsize. So, I know that deciding to not do it is a valuable outcome in of itself. But sometimes, I feel like the research you’re trying to breaking, but all they’re getting is your hypothesis is not true. It’s not true, it’s not true, and that’s valuable because you’re moving forward, but personally you’re also standing still
MURIEL WILKINS: Standing still, yup. And so, the question for you is how comfortable are you? What would you need to feel like you are still contributing value and you belong even in those times when you have to stand still because that’s the situation you’re in. Not because of your own doing, as you mentioned. It’s because of these external circumstances.
JOHN: This one I think is simply coming to grips with the fact that there are things I cannot impact in the big picture and that what I’m doing is valuable because we need to always explore what routes to take. I think I can come to grips with that. If I move my personal frustration to the side a little bit and realizing that it’s okay to be frustrated, but this is the work.
MURIEL WILKINS: Throughout this coaching conversation, we are tuning into how John’s thinking is shaping how he experiences these senior level meetings. He’s questioning whether he belongs, and underneath that, what I hear are the assumptions he’s making about himself and about how others see him. Because of his consulting background, he’s used to relying on data before drawing conclusions. That mindset works great in certain situations, but when it comes to belonging, it can actually get in the way. If you’re waiting for proof that you belong before you speak up, you’ll probably never speak up and then you never get the proof you’re looking for.
So, the work to do here is to flip that. To see belonging, not as something he has to earn, but as something he can practice. It’s not about pretending or forcing confidence. It’s about choosing a and testing it through action, speaking up, engaging, showing up even when the evidence isn’t all there yet. And there’s another layer to this. As we kept talking, it became clear that John’s sense of belonging was tied to how he defined his value. For him, value meant projects moving forward, recommendations getting implemented. That’s a natural way to measure impact, but it also puts his sense of worth in things outside of his control. In his current role, it isn’t his job to make those decisions.
So, what if he redefined his value as shaping the thinking that leads to making the right decisions rather than the decision itself. Because when your sense of value depends on things you can’t control, belonging will always feel out of reach, but when you anchor it in what you actually bring, your insight, your voice, your contribution, belonging becomes less about being accepted and more about recognizing you already have a seat at the table. Let’s get back to the conversation.
Let’s imagine you have a meeting coming up, one of these senior level meetings. “I do belong here because I was invited to the meeting and I’m here.” And we took the value I bring is to help these folks explore their options and help them make the decisions that they need to make even if they don’t move forward with one of these projects. And we’ve got to go back to the, “Well, and it’s okay if I’m frustrated, if they turn it down, but I also understand that’s part of the work.” If you took all of that as your hypothesis and your assumption moving into this next senior level meeting, what is the feeling that you believe you would have walking into that meeting?
JOHN: Even you, now describing it to me, feels like weight off the shoulders and I think I would go in a bit more relaxed and ready to talk.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what do you think about that makes you ready to talk?
JOHN: I think part of my notion around value and me thinking that I need to prove that value in the meeting by creating impact with one of these projects. I think if that notion of value is challenged to where if the project does not move forward, then you can actually, it can be paused or it can be decided not to pursue it. I think it would help me to feel less fear of failure. It’s not failure if this doesn’t happen and it’s not failure if we decide not to do it. I think I would come to grips with I’m still valuable even if that’s the case.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And so, what I think I hear you saying, John, and correct me if I’m wrong, is the stakes of what if I say something wrong wouldn’t be as high because there is really nothing wrong because you’re not pinning it on whether one of these projects moved through or not. You’re providing information that as you said, you’re the facts person.
JOHN: That’s totally right. If we use another child analogy, there’s not this perfect baby that we’re grooming to be let go into the world. It’s okay to look at it from different angles and say something that might be not at all what you want to be included in the final products.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
JOHN: That’s okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s interesting to me because your role of shaping the conversation actually gives you way more latitude to not have everything rigid as, “Stated fact, and you’ve got to be 100% certain. And oh my gosh, if you say something wrong, it’s going to blow up the whole thing.” Right?
JOHN: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: It does give you more latitude to be able to say, “Well, here’s one way we could look at it and here’s another way we could look at it.” Okay? And what I’m hearing you say is if you came in with these alternative assumptions that we just walked through and then it created a different feeling, then the outcome in terms of how you behave in the meeting might be different and more aligned with the way that you want to show up. Whether that lands itself in terms of project gets approved or not, is out of your control. So that’s not the outcome we’re looking at.
JOHN: The outcome is being present and active in meetings of all shapes and sizes.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. So, at least you give it a chance for that project to be influenced, but ultimately the decision is not yours, nor can you control the decision makers. It’s ultimately up to them.
JOHN: Yeah, that’s right. That’s a very rational way to look at it, and I think you’re spot on with having to go into these meetings with different assumptions. Yet there’s always still a little bit of that insecurity there of now do I belong, but I think that also makes sense in these types of meetings. Perhaps not the do I belong question, but more of the I need to perform now and it does need to come out and nothing coming out is not performing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. I mean, it’s a type of performing. It’s like, what is it? Silent movie ventriloquist.
JOHN: Exactly. People laugh at Charlie Chaplin.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. It’s not the type of movie you signed up for, right?
JOHN: No, exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t know. I feel very disappointed if I went to a talking movie and I show up and it’s a silent film. So, something is performative if it’s not aligned with who you actually want to be in that meeting. That’s the only way it’s performative. And so, the fact that you’re using that word, there’s something that I think you need to sit with, which is this idea that talked about, which is all the things that we just went through in terms of the different ways that you can behave in those meetings are a part of you. They’re not this other performative, not my personality. That’s why I wanted to get away from the term personality. They’re a part of you. They’re just not using them. They’re like the fork or the knife that your kid might not be using at the moment.
But in order to use it, there are certain, again, assumptions and feelings that you need to have that align with it so that there’s a higher propensity of you using it in a way that feels aligned and not performative. All right? So, I know that you said there’s still a little bit of this feeling insecure, and I know the comfortable thing would be to walk in and not feel insecure at all. Okay? But let me ask you this. What would make it okay for you, we’re going to add on a layer. What would make it okay for you to walk in with these assumptions that we just talked about and still feel a little insecure going in?
JOHN: I know everyone is insecure to some degree. Nobody is without them. I bet people across from me are insecure about something even perhaps during the meeting. So, realizing that it’s also okay to feel like that I think would help and really coming to grips with that. But yeah, realizing that it’s okay to be insecure and that the better alternative is to speak my mind.
MURIEL WILKINS: Is there a world where you can feel some insecurity and still speak your mind, is what I’m curious about?
JOHN: Yeah, of course. I mean, in a way I’m doing that. I find it tough to answer. I mean, I know that my colleagues are acceptance of me as a person. We have a great time at work. So, I think that I just need to see that this is not a singing contest and they’re going to press a big red button whenever I’m done talking. We’re colleagues and we’re trying to get something done, and it’s always okay to feel like maybe you’re stronger here and weaker in other areas, but I just need to get it through my head. There needs to be words that I need to speak my mind, and then we can talk about whether that’s the right thing or the wrong thing to do.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. That’s right. And I think what it is you have to give yourself permission to do that. And what you just said about your friends, you said your friends are or your colleagues are accepting of what you do and you have fun at work. It doesn’t sound like there’s any issue. And my question to you is what would it take for you to be accepting of yourself and give yourself permission to say what it is that you need to say, and at the same time know that, yeah, you might feel a little nervous about it, you might feel a bit frustrated, and it’s okay.
JOHN: Yeah. I just need to be comfortable that I have earned my seat at the table because I know that I have.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, and here’s the thing, John, yes, you need to be comfortable or let me say, I hope you become comfortable and it’s okay to be uncomfortable. I think you’re waiting for certain things to be in place before you speak up. Okay?
JOHN: Yes. That’s a very good way to put it.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what I want to offer you is say, okay, that would be nice, right? And is it possible that you’d speak up even if those things aren’t in place?
JOHN: Yeah, that’s a great way to put it and it describes a lot of how I go to work. Let’s put the right things in place, execute across, look back and summarize and move forward. With some of the meetings, I mean, where the topic is more free flow and we need to bounce back and forth and there’s no facts yet perhaps even to talk about, it’s more difficult because some of the structure that I would like to have to express my thoughts is missing, and I feel like in my way of communicating, I cling on to that structure because it will give me some base to work off of. But what I realize now is that sometimes in these types of meetings, that base is not yet there. We need to find what that base might be because that would make me a lot more comfortable to share, to go left or the go right because I need to be more comfortable with speaking up without certainly knowing where we’re going to end up.
MURIEL WILKINS: Bingo, bingo. That’s what I would love you to try. All right. I don’t know how it’s going to pan out, but I think it’s worth a try. What’s the worst that could happen if this next meeting that you have literally that’s what draws you. I’m going to speak up even though I’m not sure where this is going to go.
JOHN: The worst that can happen is they move on without acknowledging it or they somehow move on and after the meeting I get the feedback saying, “Hey, do you even know what’s going on here?” Getting that feedback, “Are you aware of what we’re doing here?” I guess that’s the worst feedback I expected I could have.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. How would you deal with that? Would you be able to deal with that?
JOHN: Yeah, definitely. In a way I would love that feedback because I’ll ask them, “Where did you think I went wrong?” And they’ll tell me and then I can look at it. Then it’ll be better.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, so I just want you to hold onto that because we went to worst case and I said, “Would you be able to deal with that?” Which I don’t know what the answer is. You actually said, “Definitely, I could deal with it.” If you know that you would be able to deal with the worst case, not that we want the worst case. Why would there be anything holding you back? Most of our fears come from that. We won’t be able to deal with what happens. It’s not the act of speaking up in the meeting. That’s why you were asking yourself, “What if I say something wrong?”
Because there was something around, would I be able to deal with the consequences of saying something wrong? So, we’re concerned about the consequences, not the act itself. It’s again, going back, I have teenagers, right? They’re not concerned about what they’re doing. My two teenagers. Believe me, they are not concerned at all about what they’re doing. They’re concerned, I wish more so, about the possible consequences of what they’re doing.
JOHN: Yeah, you’re completely right.
MURIEL WILKINS: We’re not changing the situation and the circumstances and the people in the room and your role and all of that at all. What we’re doing is we’re adding a different way, an alternative way, an additional way of how you can approach an experience yourself to that situation. And I think part of it is this, beyond the assumptions, beyond the feeling, beyond the speaking up, let’s fast forward and also say, “Okay, what would make me feel a little less afraid is if I know that what I think could happen, that would be worst case, I’d actually be able to deal with it. It might not be nice. It might sting. It might be a little messy, but I’d be okay.” We feel insecure when we feel like we’re not going to be okay, but if you’re like, “I’ll be all right,” Then you’re secure at a baseline level.
JOHN: That makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
JOHN: I would welcome it even. It’s an opportunity for something to happen and to learn, which makes it all the more frustrating when I can look at myself and see what I’m doing, and then it might go well once and then it will go less well again.
MURIEL WILKINS: And when that happens, what do you do?
JOHN: Either way of two things, I guess. Sometimes it validates my insecurity incident. I’ll tell myself, “See, you didn’t contribute and therefore don’t belong.” Or it’ll happen and I’ll think, “Okay, I was just off the ball today and I need, if I had just done XYZ, it would’ve been better and let’s move on.”
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, so those are two choices, right? And part of it I think is you are habitually choosing one, which is the like, “See, I told you, you don’t belong.” Reinforcing the hypothesis that is not helping you whatsoever. Right? The other choice is, “Okay. Let me learn from this. Let me try it a bit differently next time.” That’s all mindset. That’s the Carol Dweck fixed versus growth mindset. Unless there is something deeply, deeply, deeply rooted, in which case, I’m not the one to work through that with you. That would have to be explored more in another type of forum. But I think right now, at the very least, you can try it and see how it works for you.
JOHN: Yeah. No, I think you’re spot on with going in with different assumptions, being okay with the value I contribute and simply needing to take a chance if I’m okay with the consequences. Those are really the three things I took away from this so far.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, I want you to take all that. So, you have two pieces of homework. The first is, “I do think it’d be worthwhile to go get some feedback.” Not so that you change anything, but more so that you’re like, “Is that aligned with how I want to show up?” Then I know at least that’s taken care of, and all I need to do is work on perception of self-versus perception of others. Okay? The second piece of homework is everything that we’ve been talking about, you now have a newly formulated hypothesis. Take that into the next meeting.
Try this approach and just see what happens. You might come out on the other end and say that, “Muriel, that coaching was a waste of time. It led to the big red button,” which would be fine. That’s when I say blame it on the coach. And if it’s like, “Oh my gosh, I actually spoke up even once.” Or “I felt better.” Or “I felt like even if I didn’t speak up, the feeling I had in that meeting was different than what it was before.” Then we know something happened different. You responded differently than you have been. Okay?
JOHN: Yeah. Thank you.
MURIEL WILKINS: As we wrapped up, what stood out to me was how much lighter John said he felt once he gave himself permission to show up differently, not to change who he is, but to change how he’s approaching the situation. By the end, he wasn’t trying to find proof he belonged, he was starting to believe it and to act from that belief. That’s the shift that happens when we stop tying our value to misdirected outcomes and start recognizing the value we bring simply by being in the room, by contributing, engaging, and shaping the conversation. I also want to make an important point here. Coaching is not therapy. My role is not to dissect why or how a belief, I don’t belong here, formed or to help someone heal from its origin. My work is to help clients see whether that belief serves them in achieving their goals moving forward. And this belief, I don’t belong here, is one of the seven most common beliefs I’ve seen hold leaders back.
I explore all seven in my new book, Leadership Unblocked: Breakthrough the Beliefs That Limit Your Potential, which comes out October 28th. In it, just like on this show, I help you get clear on what’s getting in the way so that you can lead with more impact and ease. So, if this coaching conversation resonated with you, you can pre-order Leadership Unblocked now wherever you get your books, because that’s the work of unblocking, not changing who we are, but freeing up what’s already there. That’s it for this episode of Coaching Real Leaders. Next time.
MAGGIE: Every moment of newness that the company faced, I always was able to figure out the pieces and parts to make that work. I see myself continuing to bring that, but I think that I’ve gotten to the point where there needs to be a more refined leadership scope, and I just don’t know if I am who that organization needs at that phase.
MURIEL WILKINS: If you love the conversations we have here on Coaching Real Leaders, you’ll definitely want to check out my new book, Leadership Unblocked: Breakthrough the Beliefs That Limit Your Potential. You can order it now wherever you get your books.

Episode 3: How Do I Get Out of Constant Crisis Mode?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that, hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Margaret to protect her confidentiality. She’s an executive who’s held leadership positions for over a decade at a few different companies.
MARGARET: It is highly rewarding, it’s high visibility, it’s high impact, it’s high stress, and it requires always-on. But I really love what I do. Even when I sometimes don’t love the job, I really love the people problem-solving aspect. How do I coach people? How do I upskill them? How do I help form context? I’m aware that some of my superpowers in this role are, I’m very good at giving context, I’m very good at connecting dots for people, and I am a nerd at heart, and I love the hands-on, and I love the problem-solving.
MURIEL WILKINS: After some time at her previous organization, Margaret decided to look for a new executive position. And then she decided to take a chance and take an opportunity abroad.
MARGARET: I took it for a number of reasons. One is, it was an overseas opportunity, which was very interesting, and we’ve traveled a lot, and now we have the opportunity to travel more. We have a nice window of opportunity where kids are in good shape. They don’t need us for a little while. Parents are in good shape. Let’s just take the opportunity while we have it. And I really like the company’s mission and vision. It’s just one of those things that just really aligned.
MURIEL WILKINS: But the new role has not been without its challenges.
MARGARET: I came in, and immediately, there was a crisis. So I wound up diving in and getting very tactical and operational to help get through that crisis. Just as I was hitting a point of, “Okay, I think we’ve got everything under control. I can pull back up and really start focusing on strategy,” we had another crisis hit. My boss had to leave unexpectedly. Suddenly, I get thrown into his position. As it turns out, we also were in a situation where we were needing to cut costs. I did a big reorg. At one point, for almost the entire year last year, I had 20 direct reports, which is not tenable at all, and I wasn’t able to give them the attention that they needed. I just didn’t have the bandwidth and the capacity. And so I felt very bad about not being able to be the leader I needed to be for those folks.
MURIEL WILKINS: Margaret, like many executives, is someone who’s been in leadership roles for many years, but it still isn’t smooth sailing. She’s feeling bogged down in the tactical and managing the unexpected crises and having a hard time focusing on where she really wants to take her work and her team next. Let’s start the conversation as I ask her about where she is today, where she wants to go, and what she thinks might be standing in her way.
MARGARET: I’m now in a position where the crises are handled. I’ve got the right leadership team. What I really need to do now is what I should have done two years ago, which is, I need to build out the three to five-year strategy. I need to make sure that everybody understands what the really, really important things are, and I’m stuck. I feel like I’m still stuck in the operational pieces. I feel like I can’t really truly pull myself out of it because I can still see things happening. I’m a little exhausted. Also, I’ve sort of hit a point of, the previous two jobs, I felt like I was firing all cylinders and I had these great superpowers and getting great recognition, and I don’t feel like I have those superpowers anymore. I’m wondering if, this is a horrible thing to say, but am I past my peak? Did I expend all my superpowers? Am I just done?
But I really feel like I have writer’s block. I know what needs to be done. I really do. And doing this for a long time, I’m well-educated and well-experienced. I know I need to get this written down. I know I need a communication plan. But when I say I’m working on the plan, I’ve literally been working on it for six months. But largely, I’m just procrastinating. I want to build a plan, but there are a couple of reasons that I’m feeling stuck. One is the thing I said before, which is, there were these crises and I wound up getting sucked down in the tactical, and I’m finding it very, very hard to come back up.
MURIEL WILKINS: You faced a number of crises when you first joined the company. The role was not a role that you weren’t unfamiliar with, right?
MARGARET: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It sort of leveraged things that you had done in the past.
MARGARET: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: But you faced those crises. Those crises resulted in you having to get very tactical-
MARGARET: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: … down in the weeds. You were able to up-level your team and get past the crises. And now, you’re at a place of trying to do the longer term, thinking three to five years out, something, again, that you’re not unfamiliar with. But you’re finding yourself stuck, blocked, procrastinating from moving forward and doing it.
MARGARET: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right? Okay. Got you. Before we jump into what you believe is keeping you blocked, what does that feel like to you to feel blocked? How do you know that you are stuck?
MARGARET: I have Post-it notes all over the place with themes of things that I need to go on that three to five-year roadmap, and I can’t visualize how to put them together. I have action items on my to-do list that go undone for longer than they should, just because I look at them and go, “Mm, I don’t know if that’s important enough.” I’m having trouble prioritizing. I have a little focus issue, but I don’t actually think it’s a focus issue. That part, I can’t pinpoint. I’ve never really had problems focusing. Although I will say my calendar is full every single day, so getting any focus time to actually sit down and brainstorm and visualize and think only comes on the weekends. And by the time the weekend comes, all I really want to do is sleep. It’s like I’m exhausted.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s interesting to me because I asked you what does it feel like to you. What you are describing to me is evidence that you are stuck. But what does it actually feel like? Why is it a problem for you?
MARGARET: It feels like I’m letting the team down. It feels like I’m not doing my job. It feels like I’m not demonstrating the leadership skills that I know I have. Another example of that is, about nine months into the role, did a coaching session. I had a 360 review. And so a lot of people at the company who knew me by then knew me because of these crises. The main piece of feedback that came back was, “Wow, she’s really great in a crisis. Gosh, she really keeps a level head. She’s really good at keeping everybody calm.”
All of those things are 100% true. That is what I do and that is part of my job. That is not my only skill, and it bothers me that when people think about me and what my skill set is, that they just see, “She’s really good in a crisis,” and not, “Wow, she’s an amazing leader. Gosh, look how she inspires her team. Look how she is moving the needle on what they’re actually doing.” Because I know I can do those things. Every time I say this, I feel like I’m in victim mode, but I got waylaid by the … We had to get tactical and get things done, and I just still feel like I can’t quite pull back out.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Okay. What I’m hearing from you is, “I’m known within this organization as this leader who can … well, somebody who can handle a crisis,” because it’s interesting to me that you did not use the term leader in that realm. You just said somebody who handles crisis.
MARGARET: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: And then you juxtaposed that with that you don’t like not being seen as a leader who can inspire and coach people. We’ll get to that in a second, around why is one a leader and the other is not. But before we get there, I have a question around, if I were to ask those same folks who responded to that 360 and gave you that feedback around, “Wow, she really handles crisis well,” et cetera, et cetera, if I were to ask them what are their expectations of the individual who sits in the role that you’re in, and how do they define success for that role, what is the value they’re hoping that role brings, how would they define it?
MARGARET: That’s an interesting question, because I’m not sure they know. I think they would say my job is to make sure that the company is protected, that information is protected, that … I’m trying to figure out how to say this. This is not coming out quite right. I think they would say, “Hey, well, she knows what the job is. So we just expect her to do it well.” It’s a good question.
MURIEL WILKINS: Why is it a good question to you? What is it bringing up for you?
MARGARET: I’m not sure they know what my job is, actually, except to handle crises or prevent the crises from happening in the first place.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what if that is your job?
MARGARET: Well, it sort of is, but it’s a little bit more than that. It’s ensuring that everyone in the company understands how we manage risks across the company, and part of managing risk is managing the crises that come when a risk manifests. But part of the job is just keeping those risks from manifesting, to begin with, by communicating, by showing a cost benefit analysis on, “If we spend this much money, we can reduce the chances of this happening by this much.” It’s that latter part that I haven’t been able to do, and I don’t think my team is equipped to do yet either, and so there’s some training and upskilling that needs to happen. It’s not just that I need the head space, because I can get the head space. I need to get unstuck from where I am. I’m just handling crisis after crisis after crisis and dealing with complaint after complaint after complaint into, “I’m going to make sure that we, as an organization, are serving the business, that we are demonstrating that we can make the business better by showing how much we can save, we can improve the business.”
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. But what I’m hearing you say is, you are demonstrating value in the role. It just feels to you like you’re not demonstrating the full value that you can bring.
MARGARET: Yes, I think that’s true. Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Now, the question is, what is the value that is needed in your organization? Because I can say, “Hey, I can run 26.2 miles.” But if the race only calls for 13.1, do I really need to run the 26? I’m not going to get an extra prize for running 26.2, right? I better go find a race that requires 26.2. So I’m not saying good or bad. I’m just asking, is the need in your organization and the expectations of your organization aligned with the expectations that you have of yourself as a leader?
MARGARET: The second part of that is good. Let me come back to that. The other piece of this is I like the running analogy. I don’t think we need to run a marathon. I think we, at least, need to hit the 5K. Right now, all we’re doing is sprints, because we keep having these crises, and we’re just sprinting, and then sort of resting for a little bit, then we’re sprinting again. If we can do the 5K or the 10K, we can do fewer sprints.
If I can demonstrate, If we do these things and we do them in the right way and we do them in this methodical, ‘Here’s my long-term plan to help us get where we need,’ nobody has to keep running sprints. We actually get to run together. We get to support one another in this 5K or 10K, and we all get to the finish line at the same time. Right now, nobody’s actually getting to the finish line because these crises just keep coming.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
MARGARET: We have to stop the crises from coming, because everybody’s just going to keep getting exhausted if we don’t do it the right way.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. What conditions would need to be in place for you to be able to run to 5K? I.e., what conditions would need to be in place in order for the crises to stop coming?
MARGARET: I need to be able to articulate what the actual risks are, what we’re trying to accomplish, why it’s better for us in the long term to address these now than to keep addressing them as crises as they come up. Ultimately, when the crisis happens, we put a bunch of band-aids on and it stops again. But if we actually put the brace on first and then actually did the training, we would build up better muscle, and then we wouldn’t have to have the band-aids on all the time.
So if I can do a better job, both myself and, again, helping my team get there, of explaining, “This is our long-term journey. This is our couch potato to marathon training over the next three years. The reason it’s good for us is because you’ll be able to speed up your development and delivery because all of the right things will be in place, and you won’t get pulled back every six months because we have some sort of crisis because something didn’t go well.” There are ways that I can demonstrate. They’re not easy metrics, but there are metrics there that I can demonstrate where we can help reduce tech debt. We can reduce incidents that cost us money in the end. It’s the stopping and sitting down and getting out of my own head to write that down.
MURIEL WILKINS: What would need to be in place for you to do that? To stop and sit down and write it down. Stop, sit, and write.
MARGARET: I know it seems so easy, doesn’t it? Part of it’s calendaring, and I’m aware that that’s largely under my control most of the time. Again, when incidents keep coming up, some of it’s not under my control. I get urgent requests all the time. One other piece that’s in place is my boss. He’s also very tactical. And so what we’ve talked about, having a broader strategy that I can then also say, “I’m going to hang my strategy on your strategy and we’re going to create this vision together.” There’s no vision there.
And so I’m trying to create a vision that should be part of a broader strategy, but it’s not, because he can’t quite get there. He will say, “No, I like the strategy. I just need time.” And so I feel like I’m a little bit in the same spot. But then he’ll spend an afternoon running random reports and then send us all reports saying, “Look how bad these numbers are.” Well, that’s not strategy. That’s not what we actually need. So we wind up a little bit in whack-a-mole mode. And so part of what I wind up doing is responding to him on a regular basis and trying to follow up on these random things, which effectively is just another crisis. It’s not technically a crisis.
MURIEL WILKINS: Margaret’s situation shows us that even when you’ve led at multiple organizations for years, problems will always arise. That’s because even while drawing on your own experience and knowing what you’re capable of, the chemistry of the team, the culture of the organization, and even your own energy levels change. What started out as a problem she viewed more about her own internal ability to put together a plan, to push through what she calls her version of a writer’s block, quickly turned into a multi-layered conversation about her team and whether they need more upskilling, or whether her boss is what’s keeping her stuck. We’re still digging more into what is really holding her back from putting together a proactive plan instead of always reacting.
I love that you used whack-a-mole because I am envisioning you whacking, that game where you’re whacking them down.
MARGARET: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: Because you are. You’re in reactive mode, reacting to whatever pops up, whether it’s your boss, whether it’s whatever is happening. It’s interesting to me that I asked you, what do you need to stop, sit, and write, and you went to what’s getting in the way of you stopping, sitting, and writing. I’m still not hearing what would it take for you to stop, sit, and write this story that you actually articulated, which is the couch potato to marathon in whatever many weeks, which I love.
MARGARET: I think I might use that as our analogy now.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
MARGARET: This is our vision board.
MURIEL WILKINS: Let’s imagine. What needs to be true for you to stop, sit, and write for one hour?
MARGARET: Okay. What needs to be true? Either we need to have no more crises, which is probably unrealistic, or I need to be able to confidently delegate those crises to somebody else. That’s number one. I won’t go into whether or not I can actually do that. I’ll just say I think that’s part of it. Either I need my boss to stop randomly sending metrics or, I guess, same thing. I need to be able to confidently delegate that to somebody else to deal with. I will say, in that case, I do feel like I need to protect my team from that, to some degree, like, “Why do they need to deal with that noise?” Except that means I’m dealing with the noise. So it would be nice if he would stop. I don’t see that happening. So either I need to deal with the noise myself or be able to delegate the noise to somebody else. Or I need to figure out how to have a conversation with my boss on, “This is not productive, and you need to stop it,” which is also reasonable.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And so, Margaret, I’m going to try to keep it simple because I’m a pretty basic, simple type of person. What needed to be true and what enabled you to take the hour or two hours that we’re spending together today?
MARGARET: I put it on my calendar. I blocked it off, and I blocked off time to prep for it.
MURIEL WILKINS:
What would it take for you to do the same thing, to write your couch potato to marathon plan?
MARGARET: If it’s time on my calendar, I need to protect it and not let those crises interrupt that blocked time.
MURIEL WILKINS: What can you use from what’s happening literally right now in the moment? Because in the time that we’ve been speaking so far, and I’m going to look for wood that I can knock on. Here we go.
MARGARET: Well, I will say I was literally in a crisis meeting about an hour before you and I met.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. But yet here you are, right?
MARGARET: I am, yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: So we have evidence that it can be done.
MARGARET: It can.
MURIEL WILKINS: And that’s all I want for.
MARGARET: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. What I’m trying to figure out is, what’s the formula that allowed right now to happen, which is we’ve at least had a good chunk of time. I’m not saying it’s going to be enough to write the whole plan, but we’ve had a chunk of time right now that allowed you to do this. So what’s the formula that you can then transpose to other areas where you find you’re not getting that?
MARGARET: Not to be flippant, but this was nine o’clock my time, PM, so it’s not during my normal daytime. So it was actually easier to schedule. I am not unwilling to spend after hours time doing what I need to do, but I will also say that the brain power that it takes to do that is not something I want to do late at night, because I’ve tried it multiple times and it doesn’t work, and it doesn’t really end in good results. This takes midday, fully awake, semi-caffeinated brain power time to actually work on.
There is a piece of protecting the calendar. It seems like it should not be that hard, but there’s a … because of the job I do and because of the regular … I mean, there are literally weekly issues that happen, at least. Part of it is, I think, as we’re talking about this, figuring out how to truly delegate to somebody else and say, “You know what? For the next two hours, you need to take meetings. You need to do whatever the things are. I’m not going to put anything else on my calendar,” and trusting that they’re able to handle whatever issues come up in that moment, or conversations with other leaders that come up in that moment, and trust that I don’t actually have to be in that room.
MURIEL WILKINS: Have you ever tried that?
MARGARET: Yes. I think I’m closer now than I probably was six months ago when I had 20 direct reports. I have a leadership team in place now that, I think, is really good. I think there’s still some room for development, but I wouldn’t necessarily hesitate to put them in front of other leaders. I think I’m in a much better position than I was just a few months ago. To be honest, I also think I need to convince everybody else that the leaders I have under me now are strong. People have gotten used to coming just directly to me, and so they’ll just keep coming directly to me because they know I’ll fix their problem for them.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
MARGARET: And so I need to tell them, “Yes, I know I could fix it for you and I could probably fix it for you quickly, but I actually want you to go work with that person and let them help you fix it instead.” Because I need to start delegating so that somebody else can take this on.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. What’s coming up for me is, when you shared that you took this role overseas, and you and your partner, your husband, decided, “Yep, we’re going to do it.” You described it as there was a window where things were aligned in a way where it was possible. The kids were good. The parents are good. You have this window where you can go and do your thing. I think in a way you’re sort of describing right now creating that window, not necessarily waiting for the window to just happen, but creating the window. And so just in the same way that the window for you to be able to work overseas was the kids being good, the parents being good, all these stars aligning, I’m going to shift a little bit and say, well, what are the stars that would need to align in order for you to now have a window where you can focus and engage in these longer term, as we call them, highly important, not urgent efforts. But the difference is you’re not going to wait for them to just happen organically.
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: You’re going to try to actually align them yourself. But the first place is like, what are those stars? And then let’s talk about how you align them.
MARGARET: I like that. Thank you. I think that’s a good parallel. What stars need to be aligned? I need to have the right leadership team under me that not only do I trust, but our stakeholders also trust. I need my boss to not play whack-a-metric. I need the right support from a communications plan. I need the space to be able to communicate with the team on a regular basis, and I just haven’t been very good about doing that. It’s one of the things that doesn’t necessarily come naturally to me. I love doing it, but I really have to think about it. I’m not an extrovert, so communicating outwardly on a regular basis is not one of the first things I think about doing.
Historically, when I’ve done this and done it well, I’ve had a team around me who said, “Hey, by the way, we’re hearing stuff,” or, “We think we’re going to hear stuff soon. Can you post something? Can you say something? Can you put an email out?” Whatever. I don’t necessarily have that around me right now, so I need people around me who will help signal those things for me, like, give me the space. Trust. Time. Trust and time, I need a little inspiration that I can figure out, if I get the brain space. I can also ask my team for that. That’s the other thing. I’m also aware that they can help with this. But also, there’s a little bit of, “This is my job to create the strategy,” and to give them the messaging that then they can take forth.
I don’t want to put it on their shoulders that they’re suddenly supposed to create this strategy, although it’s a good development opportunity for them also to help me with that process. So if I can find the in-person of, say, whatever time with them and let them help with that, we’ll probably come up with a better product.
MURIEL WILKINS: There’s a couple of things there. First of all, kudos to you for identifying the stars, because there is a lot of stars out there. You could look up at the sky and not see them because it’s cloudy, et cetera. But you’re seeing the stars and then you’re picking them and you’re creating your own Big Dipper diagram to recognize, “This is what I need to align and how I need it to align in order for me to be able to have that window, that space to be able to do the strategic things that I said I want to do.” Kudos there.
One of the things to realize in choosing those stars is also which ones are actually in your control and which ones are not.
MARGARET: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so you named star number one as having a leadership team that I trust and others trust. In your control, not in your control? Where would you put that? Do you have influence over it? Do you not have influence over that?
MARGARET: I think I do, actually, to some extent. I mean, I can’t control their actions, which will, in fact, influence whether people trust them or not. But if I can communicate to our stakeholders that I trust them, and not just say the words I trust them, but actually demonstrate that I’ve put my trust in them, then that will go a long way to having the stakeholders actually trust them. Now, the actions they take after that are not under my control, and if they aren’t able to reinforce that trust, then we have to have a whole different performance conversation.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. It’s sort of like middle ground. You can’t fully control if others trust them. You can do things to influence that. But you trusting them, that is in your control. You choose whether you trust, and as you said before, one of the ways you can demonstrate that is you delegate certain things to them, which is supported by trust. So we can grab that star. That star fits in the diagram.
Star number two was boss doesn’t play whack-a-mole, whack-a-metric. In your control, not in your control?
MARGARET: Not in my control at all. I thought it was for a while, that if I just did what he asked, that it would help. But then I realized he was just going to move on to the next one and then on to the next one. 100% not in my control.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. Love it. Beautiful. Wish we could have it. Wish upon a star. Can be in the galaxy, but not part of your diagram. Let’s just put that one to the side and hope that-
MARGARET: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: … eventually, it aligns on its own.
Star number three was being able to communicate with your team on a regular basis, but also having support to help you do that, because it’s something that you know can do. But in order to be able to do it, one of the conditions that you need is support in terms of others signaling to you, “Hey, this is the time,” or, “This is what we need to do.” In your control, not in your control?
MARGARET: That one is in my control. I can pick the right people or I can communicate, at least especially with my direct staff, and say, “This is my strength. This is not my strength. I need a little help where I don’t have the strength for you to point out where I’m not communicating when I should.” Or find a comms director who can help me create the plan and identify … Even if it’s a rote on a regular cadence, it’s still getting out there. I don’t have any of that right now. It’s very ad hoc, and I know I’m doing myself a disservice by not communicating with the team on a regular basis. It’s so important from an inspiration, from a context, from an engagement standpoint, and I really feel like I’m falling down on that one.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. What is clear to me is you have outlined all the conditions that you need. There’s a distinction between, “What are the conditions that I need to be able to do this work,” versus, “How do I do the work.” And you’ve been jumping right into, “How do I actually write this plan.”
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And yet what’s keeping you stuck is the conditions haven’t been in place for you to have the space to write the plan. And so sometimes, we got to go back a couple of levels, when we’re not doing the thing that we know we’re supposed to do. Sometimes we got to lay out the conditions that then either inspire or motivate or just make it more amenable for us to actually do the thing. I think about there are certain things that I really don’t like to do. I hate working on my bills, hate having to do some administrative, and I find myself procrastinating on those things. What I learned is, like, “Let me make it an experience that is more amenable to me.” What do I do that? Well, what are the conditions that would need to be in place that would make that task, one that I really don’t enjoy, one that would be a little bit more enjoyable? You know what I do? When I have to do my bills, I light candles in my office. I have nice music playing in the background.
MARGARET: I love that.
MURIEL WILKINS: My surroundings are conducive, right?
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: I put a time limit. I align all the stars to make it-
MARGARET: That’s awesome.
MURIEL WILKINS: … a little bit more palatable, to help you focus on it. And I think that’s what you’ve been able to do here, right? Like, what are the stars?
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: What are the stars that are in your control?
MARGARET: I think you’re right. I’ve been sort of flogging myself for, “Why can’t you just sit down and get this done?” But not really thinking about what are the things that are keeping me from getting it done, and what could I change that would make it easier or pave the path for me to actually get there. It’s not just a, “I have control over my calendar. I should just figure it out.” It’s, I actually need other people to help me and give them the calendaring pieces that I can’t take on or that I shouldn’t take on, because I need to do this. Because it’s important. A lot of leaders feel like we need to shield some of our folks from overloading their plates, overburdening them. But if we don’t make the space to do those strategy things, to do the communication things, to do the visionary and inspiring things, we’re really doing them a disservice, because we’re not giving them anything to hook onto in their own daily lives.
MURIEL WILKINS: We’ve reached an important inflection point here in Margaret’s coaching conversation. When we began our session, Margaret feared that she was losing some of her superpowers, that there was something standing in the way of doing the kind of strategic long-term planning that she knew she was capable of. Getting more into the details about what was preventing her from putting a plan together, we quickly discovered that there were many other stakeholders, competing priorities, and organizational structures that were also contributing to her “writer’s block.”
It’s good to acknowledge the gray area here. Some coaching clients come with a steadfast belief that they need to change their own behavior. Others come with problems they attribute to outside forces beyond their control, like a boss. The reality is, with almost every leadership issue, it’s usually some combination of both internal and external forces helping to create hurdles. Everything, after all, is co-created.
It’s a positive sign that Margaret is taking on personal responsibility here and trying to figure out how she can change to do better, to be on the path she wants to be on while also setting the organization up for success. As she starts to think about practical steps she can take next, I was curious about how she leverages her relationships at work, and whether she was approaching them in a way to get the most out of them.
One of the words that I’ve heard you repeat a few times in the most recent part of our conversation is this word around help and asking for help. You said something a little while back around like, “Well, if I’m the leader, shouldn’t I be able …” and correct me if I’m wrong, I’m sort of using my own words here. But, “If I’m the leader, shouldn’t I be the one who creates the strategy? Should I really be putting that on them?” Inherent in that is an assumption that as a leader, you can’t ask for help.
MARGARET: I think that’s true. I mean, yes, I think there is … It may be where I came from, it might be because I’m a woman, but yes, I think when you hit a certain point, there’s a feeling of, “Well, I’m here, and clearly, I’m expected to know what to do, so I shouldn’t be asking anybody else for help because I’m supposed to know what to do.” I have also found, as I’ve moved up in my career, when people talk to you, there’s a sense of … How do I say this? Sense of responsibility to be the person who knows the things. I feel like when people are looking up to me, I’m supposed to know all the things. I’m supposed to know how to do all the things. I’m supposed to be able to just do all of the things. I’m supposed to have superpowers because I am where I am. I don’t think I’m the only one who feels like that. And so I think asking for help, particularly among peers and the folks below us, becomes very difficult as we continue up through the ranks.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s the risk of doing that?
MARGARET: The risk of doing that is that you potentially look like you don’t belong where you are.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s the risk of not doing that?
MARGARET: Well, you don’t continue to move up.
MURIEL WILKINS: So either way?
MARGARET: Yeah, exactly. Good point. Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, look, I can’t sit here and say, “No, people don’t believe that about …” I mean, I don’t know these folks. Who knows? But it is an assumption, right?
MARGARET: It is. I think it comes down a little bit to imposter syndrome, and I hate that phrase. I think we need to change the script on how we talk about that. It’s just a feeling. But it is, again, at least for women in traditionally and heavily male fields, for things that I need help with, I do in fact have a very trusted circle of people that I will ask questions of. I will not put questions out to an entire group largely because, again, there’s a little bit of, if somebody even thinks a little bit that maybe I don’t deserve to be where I am, me asking for help just reinforces that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
MARGARET: And I would not put myself in that position.
MURIEL WILKINS: I understand, and I want to respect where you are in terms of what you’re willing to do or what you’re willing to “risk” versus not willing to. You have your own boundaries around that. What was interesting to me is that in sharing, you said … There’s sort of gradients. You went from, “Well, the expectation is that I know everything and I shouldn’t ask for help.” And then there was, “I might have a few people I can ask for help, and I do have that.” And then there is, “But I can’t just put it out there to everybody and yell over the megaphone, ‘Help. Somebody come help.’“ You’re not doing that either. But there’s some gradient in there. And so you write the rules. What are the rules that would make you feel … Here’s a formula you’re solving for. You said you love solving problems. So here’s the problem. What rule would need to be in place for yourself where you could feel like you belong, and safe, and you get the help that you need? What would that look like?
MARGARET: I like framing it that way. I think that’s good, because the one thing that I do strongly believe is, the leaders that I have working for me know their space, and they probably know it a lot better than I do. And so I do, in fact, need their input and help as we’re talking about a long-term strategy, because I don’t want to impose a strategy that doesn’t make sense, because I don’t know their area.
I think asking for help in that context is, “You know your space better than I do. I would really like your input and your help on actually creating this. Let’s sit down and talk about how we do this.” Or, “Can you write down your ideas? I’ll collate all of them and then we’ll all come back together and talk about it as a group.” But it enables them to be the experts that they are. It enables them to feel like they’re supporting me in what needs to be done. It enables them to feel like they’re contributing to the larger vision and the value that we bring to our stakeholders, and it doesn’t put the entire burden on me to figure it all out.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, in a way, you’re distinguishing between where everyone adds value, right?
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: You’re leaving it up to them to add value from a subject matter expertise standpoint. As you said, you want to show up as the leader. That means you’re not the subject matter expert. That’s not your role. Do you need to know some things? Of course. We all need to know something. But is your role to know everything? Is that how you measure success in your leadership role?
MARGARET: No, that’s exhausting.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right.
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so there’s a part of this around making sure that not only are you aligning the stars, but you’re also aligning with the North Star, which is how are you defining success in this particular leadership role and operating according to that and making sure that all the other stars are aligned with that as well, which, as we talked about before, you get to place them. You get to allocate them.
MARGARET: I like the way you said that because it actually triggered … You said, “Define success in this leadership role.” I think I’ve been trying to define success in this role the way I was successful in previous roles. It’s not going to be the same formula in every role. It was for a few roles. This one’s just different for a variety of reasons, I’m sure. But I think that’s a good way to frame it going forward is, for whatever I’m doing, how do I define success in this particular role? I would use the analogy of parenting. What I do now to be a successful parent with an adult child is different than how I would’ve defined success as a parent of a toddler. Very different. It’s still parenting. Very different success criteria.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. And so guess what? You’re still leading.
MARGARET: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: If we go back to the beginning of our conversation when you’re like, “I’m just managing all these crises. I’m not leading.” Yes, you are. You’re still leading. You’ve been leading all along. And now you’re out of that, or you’re trying to find windows. So you’re still leading. And part of figuring out how do you move into this more strategic space is part of the leading. You don’t wait until you get there to lead. Aligning the stars is part of leading. Okay?
MARGARET: Yes. No, that makes sense. Yes. I really do like that framing of it, both the, How do I define success in this role? But also, the, How do I push the stars into alignment? Because you can’t just wait for them. You can see all the little blockers, but actually changing the way you’re looking at them, and which ones do I control? What can I move? Versus, what can’t I? If I can’t move it, then we control what we can control in the moment, and we do what we can do with that. That’s really helpful.
MURIEL WILKINS: Love that. Love that. Okay. I feel like this is a good time, because there’s a lot there, and I want to make sure you are able to walk away with enough in your hands versus too much, that then nothing happens. How I tend to close my meetings with all of my clients, which is, I’d love to hear where you are now versus where you were at the beginning of our conversation.
MARGARET: I feel like I knew all of this, and you just pulled it all out, putting me in a position to think about things differently. We all get a little bit stuck in our rabbit holes. I really appreciate the way that you asked different questions, gave me different framing because I really feel like I’m not stuck in that hole anymore. I feel like I can take this and now actually move forward and take some action on resigning things, reframing things, recommunicating things in order to put us all in a better space where I can help create the strategy we need. Actually, I feel a lot better. This is good. This is good.
MURIEL WILKINS: Good. I’m glad to hear it. You know what? I love the fact that we talked about stars so much today, so I’ll throw another one in there. Sometimes we just need the full moon to be out to be able to see what’s in front of us, and I think that’s what happened with you today. So now that you see it and you know what you need to do, it’s really about just committing to that next step and then keeping it moving for yourself. Okay?
MARGARET: Yes. Thank you so much. Very helpful. I appreciate it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Margaret’s leadership experience served her well in the past. But in some ways, it might be what’s keeping her from being strategic in her current role as she held onto the belief that she couldn’t ask for help and that she should have all the answers. My job as an executive coach is often to challenge those assumptions. By asking her what conditions might lead to a different outcome, Margaret realized that what was keeping her from leading strategically was in large part under her control. For her, taking steps to bring the stars into alignment wasn’t about just clearing her calendar or sitting herself down and really making herself focus. It was also about learning to lead at scale by being clear about what’s needed and asking for support. That’s it for this episode of

Episode 4: How Do I Handle So Much Organizational Uncertainty?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them, so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Maggie to protect her confidentiality. She’s been at her company for several years and seen it through many phases of growth.
MAGGIE: I’ve had the somewhat unique experience, I would say, of being with the same organization for the majority of my professional career, and when I started with the organization I’m with today, it was truly a startup. So it has been an honor to be part of that ride, and I have professionally benefited from that growth, probably elevating five to six times over the course of that company growth into new roles, learning new skill sets, et cetera.
MURIEL WILKINS: But lately Maggie has been feeling a shift and less of a tailwind than she’s felt in the past when it comes to advancing in her career.
MAGGIE: We’re on the precipice of a new era of the company where it has to function differently. We have to build to scale. We’ve got new leadership coming in and I find myself asking the question, am I who this organization needs long term? Is there a place for me in this organization long term? And I really want to come to that decision on my own before I’m forced to. It’s just been a lot of self-reflection and trying to understand if this is the place for me long term and if I can provide value.
MURIEL WILKINS: As Maggie senses the shift happening all around her, she’s been doing a lot of self-reflection and reached out for coaching because she hopes to explore whether it will continue to be the right place for her and if she might still add value as the organization scales. To help her think about how she wants to move forward, I begin by asking about what got her here and how she thinks she’s added value so far.
MAGGIE: I’m really good at taking on new challenges and new growth, and so every moment of newness that the company faced, I always was able to figure out the pieces and parts to make that work, who to work with, how to build the scalable function and how to grow in that area. And so I see myself continuing to bring that, but I think that I’ve gotten to the point where obviously with the scale and size the company is getting to, there needs be a more refined leadership scope and I just don’t know if I am who that organization needs at that phase.
MURIEL WILKINS: Have you ever felt that before that you just didn’t know if you are what the organization needs? Because you’ve been there a while and you’ve gotten elevated a few times.
MAGGIE: This is the first time I’ve really felt it, and I don’t know if it’s because there’s a new wave of leadership or if it’s just the size that we’ve reached, we just function differently than we used to, but this is definitely the first time I’ve experienced it personally.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what is it exactly that you’re experiencing that’s different?
MAGGIE: I’m feeling a change in expectations. So as we were growing in the company, it’s almost like the way to grow was to take on more responsibility and more scope, and we’ve reached a size where it’s almost like there’s more value on specialization and being really focused on a particular area, which is different than what I’ve ever experienced before. So it’s because I’ve been there for so long, my hands are in a lot of things and I have a lot of experience there, but I don’t know what my direct path is.
I’m also experiencing because it’s a whole new regime, a lot of changing tides in conversations that I’m not in. And so I’m having trouble finding my footing of what is my path forward and where do I need to lean in to really be successful long term, and is that what I want to do? Do I want to be with this organization in the next phase?
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And in the past, how did you know what your path forward was?
MAGGIE: Truly it was we have this opportunity and we don’t have anyone to do it. And so I would just raise my hand for anything that was thrown at me.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you were like, “I’m here.”
MAGGIE: Yep, “I’ll do it.”
MURIEL WILKINS: “I’ll do it.” Okay. And what’s happening now?
MAGGIE: There’s less of that and there’s a lot of talent in the organization at the top. And so there’s less of these just things that are out there that need someone to take hold of and more of a, you need to really prove your value and serve the company in a really defined way where there’s guardrails.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So I’m trying to understand whether you have gotten any indication from others around what your path might be or whether there is a path.
MAGGIE: In the new leadership, I have been given a path forward. It has changed probably three or four times, and it’s always felt like almost a surprise as it’s changing. I think there is a little bit of me looking inwardly of can I do the job that I’m being asked of because I don’t have outside perspective. I’ve been with the same company and now we’re functioning at a different level, and so can I service in that role that I’m being asked to do? And it’s a little scary. It’s almost like this is handed to me versus, “Hey, we need to solve for this problem and me volunteering for that.” So it’s been a different approach, I guess you would say.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And what’s the difference, not in the approach, but what is the difference in terms of the way that you’re responding to the opportunities based on the difference in approach?
MAGGIE: Yeah. It’s a good question. I’m probably responding in the same way. If I see a problem in front of me, I really dig in and probably overwork to build out, “Hey, I can do this job,” and almost prove myself to the person. Maybe it’s that I’m getting less feedback that it’s what they need and so I’m not sure, am I hitting the mark? Am I not? And not getting that feedback from new leadership that I don’t know well, and that doesn’t know me well.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And so what would that feedback give you?
MAGGIE: It would give me guidance that I am on the right path and probably give me more confidence that there is a seat for me in the long-term with the organization. There’s confidence that I can do the thing they’re asking of versus she’s been here for a long time, it would be noticed if she wasn’t here. Let’s just put her here for now, if that makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Got it. So what I’m sensing is there’s a lot of, I don’t knows.
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right?
MAGGIE: That’s a good way to put it.
MURIEL WILKINS: And because you’re not getting that information from others, it’s then making you question whether there’s a path for you or not. And correct me if I’m off here, but it feels like because you’re not hearing there’s a direct path for you. There’s an insinuation that there might not be a direct path for you, which there could be other possibilities as to why you’re not hearing, “Here’s the direct path.” What other possibilities could that be?
MAGGIE: I mean, the other possibilities are they don’t know what it is yet. I sometimes equate the phase that we’re in right now of someone going to the doctor where the doctor is running all of these texts and asking all these questions to get to a diagnosis. We have a new regime of leadership that’s coming in and trying to understand the business, how it got here, what’s working, what’s not working, as well as bringing in their perspective of what has worked in other industry. And so there’s a lot of that happening, which means the remit is changing constantly as more information is gathered.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so there’s a little bit of… In what you just said, there’s a lot of change in people discovering right now because they are new to the company, which is really not personal, I guess, right?
MAGGIE: Yeah. I think you’re right.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t think they’re coming in and saying, “Oh my gosh, we don’t know anything about Maggie.” I think they’re coming in and saying, “We don’t know anything about this company. How do we get it on the right trajectory? We’re figuring it out in this discovery phase as they should.” And as a result of that, they may not be able to provide this clear guidance that you are craving for. And maybe the more they don’t give it, the more you want it. The more you want-
MAGGIE: That would be it.
MURIEL WILKINS: … them solidifying. So I think there’s two parts here. I think there’s the how do you manage this precipice chapter that you’re in because you’re not quite in the new era, right? You’re on the precipice, so how do you stand on the precipice? There’s that piece. And then there’s the, “What does the future look like for me?” And how do I… Back to your original question, “Do I have a place in whatever this next new era is? And do I even want a place in that new era?”
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: There’s two pieces and I think we were jumbling up both, but in order to be able to see the new era clearly or figure out how to deal with new era, clearly you’ve got to be able to stand on the precipice with strong footing.
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah. I think you’re right.
MURIEL WILKINS: So let’s start with that and I’m going to ask you, what do you need to be able to be in this little season that you’re in? We’re calling it the precipice season. I’m imagining you actually standing on the precipice of something, so what do you need to feel like you have some strong footing there that’s in your control, by the way?
MAGGIE: Oh, see, that’s the tough part. I need constant accolades. What do I need? I think an understanding or an education of how companies at that size, our goal size function. Again, being with the same organization and seeing it grow, I only can look back and see how each stage of this company had functioned over the past decade. I don’t think I fully understand how a company at this scale and at our next scale works day to day and how all the pieces and parts come together. So I think that would be really helpful.
I think also understanding the vision of all the new leaders that are coming into the org. I think I’ve met all of them individually. I’ve had great conversations with all of them, but I don’t think they’ve even aligned on all of their individual visions for that kind of next step in growth. Knowing some of that would be helpful for me. And then also I think I need to figure out, to your point, things I can control. I need to figure out a way for me to reflect and measure if I’m being successful without hearing it directly from somebody.
MURIEL WILKINS: And that is in your control and that is this last piece that you said around how do I measure if I’m being successful without necessarily hearing it from someone? Again, I keep coming back to this image of standing on a precipice. It’s like knowing, “Yep, my two feet are still on the ground. That’s success.” Rather than waiting for the wind to shift me one way or the other or somebody else to tell me, “Oh, no, your two feet are on the ground.”
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right?
MAGGIE: yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So let’s start with that one because I think that that’s the one that you have the most control over. What would you need to do or look into to give you those measures of success that your two feet are still on the ground?
MAGGIE: I think maybe it’s just going through the exercise of, okay, what do I understand today of where the company wants to go? What do I understand today of the remit that’s kind of been drafted for me? What does success mean for that role? And then writing out what those metrics are to then determine, okay, how do I measure that? Is it in our systems? Is it through conversation? Maybe having some sort of roadmap that I can refer to on a daily basis and use as my north star could be helpful. I don’t know what else.
MURIEL WILKINS: I think that would be a great start because I think part of what’s happening is you’re sort of thinking about out there. You’re sort of like, “Oh my God. What’s happening? It’s in the future. I don’t know.” And what I’m asking you to do is look at your two feet. Are they still on the ground? Every few minutes, check down. Are the two feet still on the ground? Which translates into what you just said, is what I’m doing on a day-to-day basis or on a weekly basis, is it still adding value? Is there some success there?
And even if you don’t know if it’s what’s going to be valuable two months from now, a year from now, being able to determine, “Well, for today, this is success. How do I measure success today? What would make today a success? What would make this week successful? And let me track it.”
MAGGIE: Yeah, I’ve never thought about that starting the week to say, “Okay, it’s Monday. When I get to Friday, what are the things that I want to achieve by Friday that this week would be deemed successful?” And maybe thinking more shorter term. Then to your point, I feel like I’ve always tried to be the tip of the spear of the company and so I’ve always been like, “Okay. What is big picture we’re trying to achieve?” I think I need to rein that in a little bit. To your point, in the moment of change, since we don’t know all of those things.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly. I mean, look, I think it’s great that you’re strategic and you’re future-oriented and you think big picture. But when that’s nebulous, and it’s really not in your decision rights to figure out what that future is going to look like, that’s the new leadership. You can’t measure. And you’re asking for the impossible, which is, “I want to measure my success, but the things that I want to measure my success on are these nebulous things that don’t exist. And oh, by the way, I don’t really have any direction or say so in what that’s going to look like.”
So the question becomes then what do you do in the meantime until you get that clarity? And in the meantime, I mean, you’re there, you’re coming into work, you’re doing something, you get to lay out what you do in the short term. Focus on that just to make you feel like at least in the short term, in the precipice piece, you’re grounded. Okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So does that work? You think you’ll be able to do that?
MAGGIE: Yeah, I do. And I think I’ve used frameworks in the past for other initiatives where it’s like 30 days, 60, something like that, that’s even more shorter term I think would really help me in the day-to-day.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Just to bring you back to the basics.
Maggie is standing in the middle of a lot of change. Her company is evolving, roles are shifting, and she’s trying to make sense of where she fits. In moments like this, it’s common to feel the urge to move quickly to make a decision, just to regain control. But sometimes the most helpful thing isn’t to act right away. It’s to pause long enough to take stock of what’s really happening. This part of the conversation is about clarity. What’s actually changed around her? What’s still true about how she adds value? Without that grounding, it’s easy to react to the noise instead of the facts. As Maggie reflects on what’s right in front of her, the picture starts to come into focus. Not all at once, but piece by piece. Let’s jump back in as she begins sorting through what’s really shifting and what might just need a new perspective.
Let me ask you this, if new leadership were to come to you and say, “Maggie, you tell us what you want. Your wish is our command,” what would you say?
MAGGIE: Yeah, it’s a good question. Honestly, to their credit, there has been some of that. I keep going back to wanting to be somebody that’s thinking about the future state of the organization where it’s going. I really like to be client facing and to be large stage out there with the market. I also like to think about the vision of where the company is going. So I think there would be elements of all of those things. And I also very much pride myself on the ability to collaborate and connect across the organization. So understanding how the pieces and parts come together from a growth perspective and a positioning perspective.
So it would probably be elements of that. This goes back to what I talked about before if I don’t really know what the structure and org roles look like in larger organizations. So I think my scale and scope is probably way too large for a single role, but I haven’t gone through the exercise of chiseling that down to something more specific and measurable.
MURIEL WILKINS: By specific and measurable, what do you mean? What would that look like?
MAGGIE: I don’t know. I think it would look like something that would not have crossover across other areas of the organization like marketing or the divisions, or product or all of these different organizations. I think I’m just so used to being involved in everything that I need to probably challenge myself to think through what are the three things that I most enjoy doing and that I can provide the most value? And what does that role look like? And is that a role that this organization needs long term? And maybe that would give me some answers or direction.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, it’s interesting to me because I think what you just said now around you’re used to being involved in everything which is required when you’re in a startup. It’s like you want people who can roll up their sleeves and who can make the coffee and freaking put together the strategic plan all in one day.
MAGGIE: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Like they can do it all. And now I think what you’re seeing is that as a company scale, you don’t really need people who can do it all. I think it’s what you refer to as more specialization. And my question to you is if up until now you’ve defined your value as doing it all, what could be the new way that you could define your value that isn’t, “I do it all”?
MAGGIE:
I think that’s what I’ve been grappling with. I don’t know., maybe it comes back to being the person that people come to for a specific thing like the expert in an area. I don’t know.
MURIEL WILKINS: What is it that you don’t know?
MAGGIE: I don’t know how to grow in an organization and provide value if it doesn’t mean taking on more things.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. But do you hear how inherent in that is that you’re defining success and value as taking on more things?
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Which is great for certain types of organizations for a startup. So you could certainly do that, right? And other types of organizations. But you’re attached to, “This is how I add value by taking on more things.” Right?
So like saying, “I can only play tennis with my forehand. That’s how I win.” And you certainly, you use your forehand, and there might be other ways of also winning. And so the question is, are you willing, A, to look at other ways that you can also win the game or add value? That’s number one. And number two, do you think you can win or add value in other ways? Meaning do you have the capability to, the skill to. And then number three is are there opportunities to do so?
Whereas I think where you went straight to is what’s the opportunity? And I think we’re missing those first two, which is do you even want to move beyond this definition of value that has made you successful at this company for all this time, which is I can do all the things.
MAGGIE: Yeah. I think I do. I think it is the right next move for me in my career is to really focus in on my strengths and growth in a particular area. I also think it makes me more marketable just generally in the market to have an area of specialty. And I think it’s what this organization needs. I don’t think I’m the right person to do all of the things in my current state. Like very particular things that I could potentially plug into and strengthen. And maybe that’s where I need to focus is identifying what are those things, those specific things that there is white space currently that I have an expertise in, that I could continue to grow in and focus my energy on that?
And then maybe from there it opens up opportunity of providing more specificity to an actual role. So maybe it’s me taking advantage of this precipice era that I’m in by exploring some of those things. I wonder if that’s the way to go.
MURIEL WILKINS: If you were to go that way, do you have… And you don’t need to name them, but do you already see some of those white spaces?
MAGGIE: Yeah, I do. There are definitely things where I find myself being one of the few to be able to support an area that I have probably the most experience in that I could probably lean in more heavily. And one way that I would need to be successful in that is prioritization and letting other things go. That’s probably the step that’s going to be hardest for me, but it’s necessary for this to be successful. There are definitely a couple of things within the org that I could focus on and prioritize.
MURIEL WILKINS: And then the question becomes, what might that lead to in terms of what’s next?
MAGGIE: It would probably lead to further definition of what my role could be and also maybe clarity of my question from the beginning. Is there a seat for me or a need for me long-term in this organization? If I can identify what that white space is, prove my value in that white space and those specific areas, really further define what that role is, both by showing early success, but also having a plan of long-term success. And then I would probably be more equipped to have a conversation with leadership of like, “This is where I could provide the most value. Is this what the company needs?” And that would at least give me direction and allow me to take control of it and control of that narrative as much as I can.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I’m also intrigued by your asking, “Is this what the company needs?” One of the things that you bring to the table is you’ve been at this company for a while. You know the company. And what I’m not hearing from you is what do you think the company needs based on what you know?
MAGGIE: Yeah. I wonder if it’s a lack of confidence on my part because I don’t know this new leadership that’s coming in. And so I think I’ve maybe taken the path of, let me make sure they see my value and work extra hard so they see my value so that they keep me or uncover areas of opportunity. But I do like what you’re saying of there’s probably more that I could voice and bring to the table based on my experience the last number of years.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I think there’s an and, right? I think there’s the, “I’m bringing value and people recognize it,” but you also are in a situation where you’re not acting from a deficit. Like I said, I think there’s a huge asset in terms of what you’ve seen the company go through, you know it, you know the DNA of it, and you just said this new leadership is in discovery mode.
So could you not make their discovery easier by also saying, “Hey, let me share with you what my assessment is, what I think will be necessary, what I think would be helpful is you make these decisions, et cetera, not be overly attached to them,” but also be able to say, “Here’s what I think is going to be needed.” So it’s a parallel path between the two versus waiting for them to tell you.
MAGGIE: Yeah. I really like that, and I like that… That goes back to my original goal of wanting to be in control of my destiny as much as possible and understand where I see myself or if there’s opportunity as early as I can. I think that would provide some of that clarity to have those conversations.
MURIEL WILKINS: You brought up the word, confidence. What is it that you’re not confident? You said you question whether maybe you don’t have confidence in certain things. What is it that you’re questioning where you might have confidence?
MAGGIE: Yeah. I think it’s my lack of experience with organizations of this size and the full portfolio that we offer. I don’t know all of the infrastructure that it takes to be successful because I’ve only been with this organization and have, as you know with startups, built with tape and glue, and you just fill in the gaps where you need to, where there’s so much more complexity to organizations of a larger size that I just am not exposed to. So there’s even language that new leadership is bringing in that I haven’t heard and I know the meaning, but it’s new education for me. So I think maybe it’s some of that.
MURIEL WILKINS: I want to commend you on acknowledging that there are things you don’t know. And so if there are things you don’t know, I think it goes back to your other goal where you could be using the time now, which is, “What is it that I don’t know? And where am I still a learner? And where is it okay for me to be learning? And how can I learn now about those things? “And I also want you to outline what it is that you do know.
MAGGIE: It’s interesting you say that. I’d never thought about writing that down. And I think that that would allow me to really think about those things. I think there’s more that I know that I’m not sharing because I don’t… In the moment, I’m not thinking about it, but it’s something that they wouldn’t be exposed to yet that could be valuable in that moment. And to go through the exercise of writing all that down feels like a really obvious thing I haven’t done.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t know if it’s obvious, right? It doesn’t matter. You haven’t done it and maybe it would be helpful to you now, but I think this notion of I don’t have… Or I lack some confidence because I don’t know all these things, or there’s some things that I’m not familiar with. So two things there. One is there are some things that you do know, so let’s chop half of the confidences there because you do know some things. But the other is just because certain things doesn’t mean that you can’t be confident. The confidence doesn’t come from you whether you know something or don’t know it. The confidence comes from whether you believe you have the ability to learn those things.
MAGGIE: And that’s one area that I’ve always felt strong and I feel like I find energy in spaces where I don’t know how to do the things. And then figuring them out is the joy that I find in working, especially at this organization. So I like that exercise of thinking about it. And even just that kind of mantra. I almost want to write down what you just said and put it on the wall of confidences from the ability to learn, not knowing everything in the conversation.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. Because as you have experienced through your years of working there and having been elevated multiple times, I’m sure each time you were elevated, you didn’t come in and be like, “Oh my God, I know everything.” But you had the confidence say, “I can figure it out.” And I think that there’s a part of this around you can figure it out. There are certain things around what does it mean to operate at this scale that you can figure out? The question is then going to become, can you figure it out at the pace and at the level at which the organization and/or leadership will need? That’s the unknown factor. It is also the factor that you do not have control over right now, primarily because it doesn’t sound like they know.
MAGGIE: Yeah, that’s very true.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right?
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I wish I could sit here and say, “Oh my gosh, yes, this is exactly what you need to do to be able to step into this next path or next chapter. But that next path is unknown right now. So we don’t know what it will be until they make a decision. But can you help inform? Can you demonstrate the value that you do bring? Can you amp up the value in areas that you haven’t yet? In the meantime, absolutely.
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: As Maggie started thinking about whether she had a future in her organization, her mind went straight to the question of opportunity, what might be next? But before looking ahead, it’s often helpful to pause and get clear on how you define your value right now. In a perfect world, that process would be neat. You’d line up what you do well, what you want to grow in and what your company needs. But that’s not Maggie’s reality at the moment. The organization is in flux and she doesn’t have a clear sense of what it will value next.
In moments like that, the best place to start is with what’s steady, your own skills, your patterns of impact, the things that have consistently grounded your leadership. Maggie is open to exploring that, which is key. But defining value doesn’t happen in isolation. Every leader operates within a web of relationships, mentors, peers, team members who can reflect back what they see. So next we turn toward that. Who’s in her ecosystem and how she might use those perspectives to see herself more clearly. Let’s dive back into the conversation.
MAGGIE: I have a couple of peers that have been my colleagues for a number of years that are my support system, that I’m at a deeper level with them where I can have some more of these conversations. And I have a couple of colleagues, my network that I’ve kept up in touch with for the past couple of years that I’ve been talking to. But I appreciate you saying that because I do sometimes feel like I don’t have many people I can talk to because of, I don’t want anything I say to be used against me, to be leveraged against me. And there are some situations where that might happen.
So I think I do sometimes feel like I’m in a vacuum. I’m also stepping tentatively into a role where the team isn’t built yet. There’s a lot of gray area that I’m trying to navigate and wade through and I want to come off like I have everything together and not show any type of weakness with all of the people I engage with day to day. So it is a really good question. I haven’t prioritized growing my network and my support system and I wonder if there are things I can do to do that in the short term.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, part of it is having that support system with, again, I’m assuming you’re not the only person who’s still here from the past years of the organization, but I’m also wondering what are you doing to build your relationship with these newcomers?
MAGGIE: Yeah. I have done a couple of things, one is, I have had a lot of discovery meetings with them, building bridges, sharing as much knowledge as I can, and gaps and opportunities. I’ve also been incredibly transparent with leaders in terms of where we are as an organization, where there’s opportunity, et cetera. So I’m trying to be open to them as much as possible and part of the conversation, but I don’t know if I’ve done anything strategic or super organized in terms of bridging the gap for them.
MURIEL WILKINS: What would that look like if it was strategic and super organized?
MAGGIE: I don’t know. That’s a great question. I almost wish I could put together a business plan of how I envision the particular org within the org that I’m in, but with things changing so much and being unclear on what that role is, I don’t know if I have enough of the information to do that. So I guess, I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that question. It’s good one.
MURIEL WILKINS: So if you were to put that together today, you don’t think you’d be able to based on what you do know?
MAGGIE: I probably could put something together today maybe. Yeah, I don’t know.
MURIEL WILKINS: What would be your concern if you did that? And I’m not suggesting that’s what you do.
MAGGIE: No, I hear you.
MURIEL WILKINS: Just playing around with it. But what would be your concern if you put that today and then you went out and socialize it with some of these folks? What’s your concern?
MAGGIE: I guess my concern is that it wouldn’t be well received. Maybe it wouldn’t be aligned with what they were looking to do. Maybe it would expose me and my lack of experience in that type of thing.
MURIEL WILKINS: And then what would happen?
MAGGIE: Loss of confidence that I could do the job.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, I feel like it would put you right back to where you were at the beginning of this conversation, right? So I’m asking because I think what I’m hearing you say is that you’re stopping yourself from leaning in more out of fear that it’s not going to be accepted. If it’s not accepted, something bad is going to happen, and the bad thing is you’ll lose your confidence or you won’t get the job, or things will be unclear, or maybe you won’t… I don’t know. You didn’t state it, but maybe they will not find a role for you there, right?
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And I guess my question to you is does that possibility exist whether you lean in or you don’t lean in?
MAGGIE: Probably. And maybe there is a world where they’re looking for that. They’re looking for somebody to step up and approach this more at a senior leader level than what maybe I’ve been approaching in the past. So there could actually be value in that. And to your point, if I do it or I don’t, I’m in the same place.
MURIEL WILKINS: You’re in the same place. And again, I’m not advocating for one way or the other. What I’m advocating for is to see that you have choice and you have different paths you can walk down rather than the one that you’ve been on right now which feels different than what you’ve done for your whole career, which is let me be in protective mode. Let me lay low, and hopefully they won’t see where I may be lacking. Maybe. Okay? I think the fact of the matter is whether there’s a place for you at the organization or not, it is what it is. That happens all the time. I’m not going to sit here and be like, “Of course there’s going to be a place for you in your organization.” We keep coming back to the same thing, we don’t know. And you will not know until they sort of have outlined what the future of the organization looks like.
But in the meantime, you can start walking off the precipice in a multitude of ways. One is to lay low. The other is to say, “Okay, I’m going to lean in and I’m going to… on the things that I do know and where I do think I can add structure, and where I do think I can be value additive in helping them figure out what the future looks like.”
MAGGIE: And I think if I can do what you had shared earlier, which is to identify what are those two to three things, what are those areas that I really want to lean in on and focus on that as I’m building out a recommendation, I think that that could help define a potential role, could help define what I’m recommending in terms of the division and the growth and might potentially lead to some really good conversation versus just waiting for the new tide to shift or the new wind.
MURIEL WILKINS: And let’s say you did that and fast forward a year from now. Let’s say there is not a new role. I know I’m supposed to be like glass half full, but I’m going to play glass half empty here.
MAGGIE: I’m here for it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Let’s say there is not a new role, then what? what would you do?
MAGGIE: I guess, look for a new role. I don’t know. I’d probably start the process of figuring out, “Okay, what are some pivots I can do with my career? Or what are some roles I should be looking for?” Maybe take by learnings from these exercises you’ve shared here and say, “Okay. I get a sense of where my strengths are,” and start getting a feel for what the market is looking like. And then also concurrently building out my network, strengthening my network.
MURIEL WILKINS: How does that feel to you even thinking about it?
MAGGIE: A little overwhelming, truthfully. I mean for anybody, I’m sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: What makes it overwhelming for you?
MAGGIE: I haven’t gone through that process in a long time, and so it would be uncharted territory in a way. There’s also, and I think I’m assuming others experience this with startups where you get emotionally attached to them because you’ve seen such growth, and I’ve been honored to be part of that, that it would be bittersweet to not be part of the next level. So I think it’d be all those feelings.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, of course. I could sense that as you were talking about, “Oh, I’d have to look for a new job.” And I could resonate. I could feel that you were like, “I haven’t done that in so long. What does that even look like? Do I want to?” And as you just shared, the emotional attachment to the organization and wanting to continue on with it’s making me. My kids are about to go off to college and I’m about to become what they call an empty nester. I refuse to adopt that term.
MAGGIE: Sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: And part of it is, it’s bittersweet, right? You’re attached and you want to let it go because what are the possibilities? And I bring you back to the beginning of our conversation, which is when you said, “I want to make sure also and respect and honor that I’m in an organization where what I bring to the table is what’s needed.” And so in a way, it’s like in what way do you honor yourself in whatever next chapter that is?
MAGGIE: Yeah. That’s such a nice way to put it. That’s another thing I want to print out on my wall. No, I think that’s a really wise way to put it because it’s like I need to think about myself where I get energy, where I want to see growth as well and that could be another ways. And that shouldn’t be as scary or I shouldn’t give that as much power.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, it can be scary. It can be scary, and it doesn’t mean that because it’s scary, you can’t do something different. Your journey so far with this organization has definitely had its purpose. The question is, “Does it still serve the purpose that you want to serve?” So there’s two levels here. There’s this sort of like, “Does it still fit?” And the other level is, “Oh my God, I don’t want to go through the tactical stuff of finding a new job,” which I get because that’s uncomfortable and you haven’t done it in a long time, and it doesn’t mean that you can’t do it if it came to that. So what I want to make sure is that you’re not operating today out of fear of what might happen a year from now or the discomfort you might feel a year from now.
MAGGIE: Yeah. That’s a really, really smart way to put it. It would limit. It’s like, how do I lean in fully into the way I’m thinking about things with confidence and understand that that could mean a number of different paths depending on how it’s received and being okay with that. I think you’re right. It’s really important.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. Because on the other side even if it’s uncomfortable, even if it’s a pain to have to go through the emotional, dis-attachment and the job search, I think what you’re saying is, “Yeah, I wouldn’t like it, but I could do it. Okay. Well, I’ll be fine. So what does that mean for me today rather than reacting based on what I don’t want in the future. Which by the way, we are totally making up because we don’t know.
MAGGIE: We don’t know.
MURIEL WILKINS: We don’t know what these people want. Right?
MAGGIE: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I think a big piece of this, Maggie, is to focus. I can’t believe I’m saying this because so often with my clients I’m like, “Big picture. Let’s think about the future, blah, blah, blah.” In your case, I actually think your power is in thinking about the short term and bringing it back to what can you do now, and waiting till there’s more clarity about the future, both from the organization and leadership, but also for yourself as you try these new things before making any decisions about them.
MAGGIE: Yeah. I think you’re right. I think also too, I haven’t done this, but really documenting what I’m experiencing, the type of feedback that I’m getting, the shifts that I’m noticing, and starting to write those out so I can start to get a sense of how things are continuing to change as I’m looking inwardly and honing in on my focus and thinking about those strengths, I think could be helpful.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, I think that coupled with getting to know some of these folks more and voicing more leveraging the knowledge that you do have and experience that you do have rather than focusing on what you don’t and seeing what you can bring to the table from that perspective.
MAGGIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Will again help you sort of stay grounded in what you do have rather than what you don’t have.
MAGGIE: Yeah, I like that a lot.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So tell me what you came in looking for and tell me what you’re leaving with instead, or maybe you are leaving with what you came in looking for.
MAGGIE: Yeah. I appreciate it. I think I came in looking for clarity, how to navigate what to me feels like a constantly changing organization with a lot of new ideas and perspectives. What I’ve gained from this conversation is a framework to start thinking about my next step and my path forward and thinking about and honestly, an acceptance of this precipice era. And I like that you put a name to it because I’ve been avoiding it and just constantly trying to say, “This is how it’s going to be. Oh, we shifted this today. This is how it’s going to be.”
And I think I need to just accept we are in an era of change and I need to be okay with that. And how can I use that to my advantage? So I’m living with that as well as you’ve given me a lot of really smart ways to think about how can I start goal setting for the short term? How can I start showing my successes even on a weekly basis and really starting to self-reflect on what are the areas that I, A, think I can bring the most value to the organization, but also where I’m energized and want to work in. And do they align? And I think even just that exercise will give me some clarity.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, I love it. So much can be done in the precipice era. We think we’d need to just freeze and get over it real quick. Are we jumping or not? What are we doing?
MAGGIE: Nope.
MURIEL WILKINS: I know. You just stay and there’s so much to be done in this staying.
MAGGIE: So much. And you would think I would be used to it from this startup, but it just felt so differently this time and it’s been helpful to name it, so I appreciate that.
MURIEL WILKINS: With many leaders, the work is about zooming out, seeing the big picture, setting direction. But in Maggie’s case, what’s most useful right now is the opposite. Narrowing the focus to what’s right in front of her, the day to day, the small steps that help her feel steady while the larger picture keeps shifting. When things are uncertain, grounding yourself in what you can do and what you do have builds confidence. It’s how leaders adapt no matter how the story unfolds. And sometimes facing the scenario you fear most, naming it, really looking at it takes the power out of it. You start to realize even if the outcome isn’t what you hoped for, you can handle it. That’s the real work of a precipice moment. It’s not about predicting what’s next. It’s about trusting that whatever comes, you have enough agency and enough clarity to meet it.
That’s the path of your precipice era. And part of what makes that hard for many leaders and for Maggie is a familiar belief, the feeling that I need to be involved. It’s that sense that our value depends on being in everything everywhere all the time. I write about that belief in my book, Leadership Unblocked: Break Through the Beliefs That Limit Your Potential. What Maggie’s story reminds us is that growth often comes from loosening that grip, focusing on what’s truly ours to lead and trusting what we’ve built to stand on its own. If this conversation resonated with you, Leadership Unblocked is available now wherever you get your book. Just like on this show, it’s about getting clear on what’s in your way so you can lead with more impact and more ease.
That’s it for this episode of Coaching Real Leaders. Next time…
THOMAS: Dealing with the people that are directly below me, that have been here longer than me has been the biggest challenge. Making sure that I don’t bring down morale, but at the same time that I do have that heavy hand because there’s just been a lot of pushback. So just maintaining a good balance while also maintaining a strong presence.

Episode 4: How Do I Deal with a Competitive Peer?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS:  I am Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals, and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Elsie to protect her confidentiality. She’s been at the director level for a few years, and her goal is to next become a VP, a leadership position she never would have imagined earlier in her life.
ELSIE: I did not seek out leadership at any point in my career. I did not know that that was going to be in the cards for me. It wasn’t something that I specifically directed myself towards as far as education or development until I was identified as someone that could potentially have those skills.
MURIEL WILKINS: Despite feeling like she’s succeeding in her current role, Elsie is concerned that tension with a colleague could be standing in her way of being promoted to VP. That colleague had been a mentor and previously held the director role that Elsie is in, but now they’re peers and the situation has changed.
ELSIE:  It was really this individual that I’m now struggling with who identified that things I was doing just naturally, my natural habits and work ethic, could benefit our company in a leadership role. Since that transition happened, it hasn’t been a very smooth road. There’s been some clashing. We don’t agree on a lot of things. We have different leadership styles, so that has been challenging.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Before I dive into the relationship tension with her colleague, I wanted to take a step back and further understand why Elsie was identified as a high potential leader and to get a better picture of her strengths. That’s where we begin.
ELSIE:  So when I was first identified, I think it was mostly the fact that I’m just a very hard worker. And when I say hard worker, it doesn’t feel hard to me because I feel like I’m just doing my job. And so I was usually the first one to volunteer for special projects, for working overtime, for taking additional shifts in just a staff position. And that was highly valued at the company that I’m currently in. And so the individual who mentored me recognized that being similar qualities to them, a kind of a kindred spirit, so to speak, and convinced me that that was a strong suit and that would do me well in leadership.
And then from there, now that I report to someone else, my leader says that I’m very thorough in what I do. I have a certain level of empathy and I’m an emotional person, so I can relate to the staff, but I also can be very objective. Because I do the research, I find all the facts, I really get to the bottom of things before I assume anything. And I love to read and study and learn, so I’ve just been continually taking classes and doing other leadership things to try to better myself, which has also been recognized. I’m doing the work, I’m putting in the work, and so far I’ve been effective and I’ve gotten much feedback that what I’m doing is good. I don’t know that I feel it quite yet, but that’s where we’re at.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Okay. It sounds like everything you’ve mentioned around strong work ethic, taking initiative, being able to have the EQ to connect with others while still the objectivity to challenge and drive for results. That is the things that we look for foundationally in a leader. And I hear you around having gotten that feedback that you’re effective, and yet you’re saying you don’t quite feel it. What is it that you do feel?
ELSIE:  I feel like I could always do better and more, which I know is silly, and that’s a recipe for burnout. But also in my work, whether it’s normal leadership things or extra projects or whatever that I’m taking on, I always just feel like I am doing my job. I never feel like I’m going above and beyond. And I have a hard time with individuals who I don’t feel like are meeting their potential or working to their capabilities, because that just seems natural to me. Why would I work any less hard or not use my skills? And apparently that’s not as common as I like to think. And so that is something that to me, it just doesn’t feel like extra or above and beyond or anything special, because I’m doing the job that I was hired to do and promoted to do.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Okay. So on the one hand, you feel like you can be doing better or more, and on the other hand you’re feeling like I’m working to the max that I can. Is that correct, or no? Tell me what the…
ELSIE:  Well, so to be fair, I have a lot on my plate. So I think that is part of it. I feel like I am maxing myself out most days, most weeks, however, I still have a pile of things that I feel like I will never get to. And that over time does make me feel like, am I really cut out for this? Can I really keep up with this pace and do this work at even a higher level potentially in the future?
MURIEL WILKINS:  Okay, I understand, yeah. And I think the more productive you are, the more there is to do.
ELSIE:  The more projects you get.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Exactly, exactly. So now you’re thinking about that next step and you’re thinking about potentially advancing in your leadership journey, you like leading, you think you’re pretty good at it.
ELSIE:  From what I’m told.
MURIEL WILKINS:  That’s what you’re told. So you think you’re pretty good at it and you think you could be doing more, how about that?
ELSIE:  Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Yes or no?
ELSIE:  Yeah. Yes, I think that’s accurate.
MURIEL WILKINS:  I’m not going to tell you about… Okay, we’re going to go with that for now. I don’t know if that’s what it is, we’ll get there. And you’re trying to figure out how to position yourself for that next step, but there’s a bit of a roadblock as you’re thinking about that.
ELSIE:  Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Okay, so tell me about your roadblock. What’s going on? Why is it a roadblock?
ELSIE:  So a little bit more context, there is definitely a boys club mentality in some of the upper leadership and so I’ve found it challenging to find my way into that boys club. And then the individual who I’m struggling with, he has made himself comfortable in that boys club. And so while I am here doing everything by the book, going through the correct channels of authority if I need something done or approved or whatever, and he just goes right into the owner’s office and gets what he wants, which is frustrating.
And so I have some theories as to why that is, but I think my main purpose or goal at this point is how do I rise above that? How do I get to a place where I’m positioned to take that next step if and when it becomes available, because this peer is also at a level where he could want to take that next step as well into a role that I would want? And I want to, regardless of reasons or personalities, I just want to be able to rise above that and position myself in the best way possible.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Okay. So there’s a lot there.
ELSIE:  There is a lot, I’m sorry.
MURIEL WILKINS:  Oh, you don’t have to apologize. Deep breath for both of us. Let me ask first, because you described it as a boys club in leadership, in the more senior ranks of leadership. And I just want to understand what that actually means in your context, because the way I might configure what a boys club is is different than what you might be experiencing. So how are you experiencing what then makes you articulate it as a boys club?
ELSIE: Great question. The majority of executive leadership are all male. And so they have their way of doing things, which in my experience and opinion is the old school, the deals made over a drink with each other, with partners, etc., and not really allowing others to have any influence over decisions or company direction or anything like that. That’s shifting, but it’s still heavily male in those ranks. There are a few of us female leaders. The way that I feel it the most is I don’t hear from any of the executive leadership unless there’s a problem and an emergency, and then it’s like, “Fix this right now.”
But even when I’m doing great things, not so great things, I don’t hear any feedback. And I’m never invited to the table, so to speak, when it comes to the bigger decisions, I’m usually being told, “This is what’s going to happen with your department.” This could just be me feeling like it is a gender issue, but with it being all males at that level and not seeing the female representation like it should be, I think that’s a part of it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And your lived experience is helping you create an attribution as to why these things are happening. I am not here to say one way or the other, because that would be me projecting my experience on you and that would not be beneficial for any of us. What we need to work through is if that’s the way you’re experiencing it, as there being this gender separation that is causing you to then not be at the table or not hearing from certain people, we need to then think about what can you do within that context. So you’ve been experiencing this for a while, I’m just curious, what impact has it had on you?
ELSIE: It’s very discouraging in a couple of different ways. So it’s discouraging because the individual who I feel is really the biggest roadblock was previously a mentor, and I truly wouldn’t be where I am in the company today if it wasn’t for this person. And so there’s guilt around that. There’s also frustration, because I’ve brought this to my manager’s attention, his manager’s attention. It’s not a secret that anybody’s keeping. I’m not keeping it to myself and suffering in silence. It’s very apparent. And I’ve had direct conversations with this individual explaining exactly how I feel, what he’s doing, whether he means to or not, this is what’s happening. And nothing ever changes. So it is very discouraging.
And where it gets immensely discouraging is the possibility of a position in the future that there’s only one of, and at this point in time today, it would be between him and I. And I fear that I would not be the first choice because of the way that he leads and the way that he manages has been undermining and overriding my style for so long.
MURIEL WILKINS: And look, I want to acknowledge the frustration or the disappointment as you put it. What’s behind the disappointment? What are you disappointed in?
ELSIE: So when I say different leadership styles, I can elaborate a little bit. So this individual manages by crisis and I believe enjoys the thrill of fixing the problem, putting out the fire, etc. That drives me crazy and would cause me to burn out very quickly. So I proactively manage, and I look at a problem in a bigger picture and try to change the policies, the procedures, the resources that caused that problem in the first place so that it doesn’t keep happening. And those two leadership styles, also personality styles are very different. So I am a little bit more quiet. I like to observe and learn before I speak up. He likes to walk into a room and be the loudest center of attention person, which there’s nothing wrong with that, but in my experience with this company that is more valued because he’s just there and in their face and loud, and here’s what I did. I saved the day. I fixed this problem, etc.
Where I’m in the background a little bit more doing great things from what I’m told and from my feedback that I’m getting, but not getting the recognition because I don’t want to be the center of attention. That’s just not my personality. I’m more of a quiet person that will absolutely speak up when I need to, but that’s not my goal every time I walk into a room. So that’s really challenging to have those different leadership styles and be perceived, I think in different ways. I’m told all the time that I’m quiet, which makes me a little crazy. Because I’m quiet because I’m observing, I’m learning, I’m watching, and I don’t feel like adding fluff to conversations. I don’t need to pull in a story every time something comes up and just make everything about me or put the spotlight back on me. I will absolutely speak up and be very loud if I need to in the right context, in the right setting, I think I fly under the radar, and so those upper leadership that really need to be the ones to see what I’m doing that aren’t seeing it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, I understand. And you just said something now, which is you will absolutely speak up and be loud if you need to, which means you have the ability to do it, right?
ELSIE: I do. And maybe I should clarify that a little bit. My personality is not loud and boisterous and over the top all the time, and that’s where I think I’m going unnoticed. If I have something to say, if I’m doing a presentation, if I have a concern, I will bring it up and I will speak and I will be very adamant and very direct. I’ve been very direct with this individual, but just on a regular normal day, I’m not bouncing all over the place. I just don’t have that level of energy or that type of personality.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. What struck me is when you said, “I can do these things if I need to,” which is really kind of advocate for yourself.
ELSIE: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. What makes you feel like you need to do that versus not?
ELSIE: I think it’s the recognition that my peer gets that I don’t, and that to me, in my lived experience is because he’s loud and in your face. And I don’t mean that in a negative way, it’s just a personality difference. But for whatever reason, that type of personality seems to get more attention, seems to just be at the forefront of everyone’s minds. I am still struggling with getting a lot of the leadership to understand that that’s not his job anymore. It’s like, “Oh no, actually I’m supposed to go to Elsie.” And it’s so frustrating to have to continuously do that.
MURIEL WILKINS: When opportunities for next level roles become far and few between, it’s natural to feel like competition is brewing with peers who are also contenders. In Elsie’s case, that sense of competition is heightened because of the differences in style between her and her colleague, whose approach seems to be more valued by leadership and she feels disadvantaged because she’s not part of the boys club as she puts it. It’s important that when my clients experience being othered, that I acknowledge it because it is their experience and my job is to help them figure out how to operate in that context.
And while I can empathize with Elsie and the circumstances she faces, the reality is that you can’t always change someone else’s behavior or a company culture to get what you want and what you deserve, but you are able to flex your perspective and your approach to align with your end goal. So with that in mind, I wanted to hone in on what Elsie might want to do to improve her situation as it stands today. And that starts by better understanding the tension she’s feeling with her peer.
So the question really becomes like, what do you want to do, which is different than what you need to do in this situation. Okay. Let’s start with the need. If you were talking to a friend right now dealing with the exact same situation at a different company, what advice would you give them?
ELSIE: I would make sure that they’ve brought it to the correct attention of management and leadership. Expressed your concerns if possible, directly with the individual. I feel like that’s probably the most effective, but if that doesn’t work, bring in their leader, your leader, go up the route that you need to go. Beyond that, that’s where I get stuck. So I don’t know what other advice I would give, and those are the things that I’ve done. So I know that it hasn’t worked in my situation, but I’d like to think if talking with a friend it might.
MURIEL WILKINS: It hasn’t worked. What are you using as a metric of whether it’s worked or not worked?
ELSIE: I’ve had the conversations and the ones that are the most frustrating are the ones I have directly with this individual because I feel like at the time when we’re speaking, we come to an understanding. We make agreements to communicate better and not try to trip over each other. And then a few weeks, a few days later, another situation happens where I find out after the fact that he did something or made a decision or had a meeting without me and didn’t invite me when it’s 100% within my umbrella of authority and not his anymore.
Part of the struggle is yes, he used to do this job, so I think he feels like he knows better than I do, having more experience and having done the same things before. So we don’t agree on the way that we go about solving problems. And so it just keeps happening. There was a situation that happened that was very upsetting and I just brought it right to him, and again, we agreed we need to communicate more. Please don’t, you got to let go of your old position. Just all the same thing, all the same words were said, and I was optimistic, but also very hesitant to be optimistic, if that makes sense. Because it keeps happening.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So look, in any given situation, you can do nothing, which clearly has not been the way you’ve approached this. You can try to change the other person, which I think is what you’ve been trying to do, or you can change your response to the situation or you can exit the situation. Those are generally ways to think about it. And by the way, none of those have guarantees.
ELSIE: Sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you’ve tried to change how he operates and that doesn’t seem to be working.
ELSIE: No.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So what do you feel you would need to do differently than what you’re doing now in order to be able to attain the outcomes that you want? And before you answer that, I think there’s a sub-question that we haven’t really clarified, which is, what is the outcome that you want? What is it that you want?
ELSIE: I want to be the first person that comes to the mind of the executive team if and when a next-level position opens, that I think is my ultimate outcome. I want my results, my work ethic to speak for itself, so to speak. And I want there to be no doubt when that day comes if that day comes, that I’m the best qualified for this position, I think I have to change my response to the way that he is behaving. To me, that seems I have explored the exit option as well. I don’t think I’m ready for that. I feel like I have more to give to this company. But I will tell you, if that position opened tomorrow and it went to him, I would promptly be looking for another position because I would feel very disrespected, I think, if that were to happen.
MURIEL WILKINS: All right. So you’ve sort of thought through if then what, because yes. I love that you’re saying, I have a lot to give this company, and in order to be able to give, there needs to be one that is ready and wanting to receive.
ELSIE: Right, yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: I could give a bunch of money out there and if there’s nobody to receive it, the check comes back. That’s the way it works. That happened recently. It wasn’t a bunch of money, but I was paying something for my dad and then they sent the check back and I was like, “Oh.”
ELSIE: I guess they didn’t want it.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m ready to give. But clearly they don’t want it. So what you’re saying is you have things that you think are valuable that you want to give the company, and there’s a possibility that’s the reality of it. In an ideal world, they would want it.
ELSIE: Sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: The reality of it might be that that’s not what they want, and I hate that, but that’s the way it is. All right. But we’re not there yet. In the meantime, you’re saying, “Okay, how do I respond differently so that I can show up as the best qualified for this position?”
So I want you to imagine for a minute that the response is not to this individual. The question is not about how do I make myself one up this individual? I know that’s not the exact words, but it’s not in response to him. Okay. I want you to think about this from the perspective of there is a particular role that I’m interested in. I’m interested in advancing to the next step. And the question really is, what do I need to do in order to be visible and seen as somebody who is qualified for the role in the eyes of the decision makers of this company? And you know who those decision makers are. I don’t know them.
ELSIE: Yes. I think I need to make myself more visible. I think I need to invite myself into some of these offices, not in quite the loud, obnoxious way that I’ve observed, but more of a, “Hey, I just wanted to check in and give you an update on this project that I’m working on.” And I think I need to be much more proactive about that. I think I’ve been waiting to be invited, which hasn’t worked, and I think I just need to insert myself at times. I know all of these individuals, I work with them, I see them, I say good morning to them every day, but I’m not having genuine conversations, if that makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: So what you’re saying is in order to be at the table in this particular company, you kind of can’t wait to be invited. You just have to sort of say, “Hey, I’m here.”
ELSIE: Yeah. That’s really tough.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s tough about it?
ELSIE: This is where the self-confidence issue starts happening.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So tell me more. What makes it tough?
ELSIE: Everybody’s busy. So I don’t think anybody wants those time-wasting conversations. And so it’s feeling confident enough that I have information that is valuable to interrupt whatever, a morning email session or something and just go in and say, “Hey, can I chat with you for five minutes about this project that I’m working on? I wanted you to be aware, or here’s my progress, or here’s my struggles.”
Another part that I think I need to be better at is I relied pretty heavily on my direct leader as kind of a bridge in between executive committee and myself. And I think I need to stop letting her do that so much. I think she does it partially to protect me in ways, but I also sometimes feel like maybe she doesn’t have the confidence in me. If she doesn’t have the confidence in me, how am I going to have the confidence in myself? I think I need to start proving myself to her in a way as well by just going to some of these decision makers and making myself known, I think.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. You think, you think?
ELSIE: None of this is for sure, but that’s-
MURIEL WILKINS: Listen, nothing is for sure, but we’re trying to get there. We’re a little more sure than we were a few minutes ago.
ELSIE: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you sort of brought up two things. One is, huh, okay, yes, I can kind of go to these meetings, but then what the heck do I say when I get there? Right? Is it going to be valuable or are people going to think it’s a waste of time? And then you talked about the fact that a lot of times your manager, for whatever reason, I mean there’s a bunch of different reasons why it could be happening, sort of acts as your ambassador, your representative, and therefore you don’t have to show your face or be the one because she sort of takes it on. Right.
Let’s unpack that a little bit because I think there might be different strategies behind both of those. The first one being, will what I have to contribute be valued? That’s what I heard. Is that on point?
ELSIE: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: What makes you feel like what you have to contribute would not be valued?
ELSIE: I get the feeling that, that level of our leadership, I don’t want to say care, doesn’t always pay attention to what the individual departments are doing. They just want everything to be taken care of. So this is what I say when I mean, I only hear from them when there’s a problem that gets to their level and then it’s an emergency, fix this right now. This is your responsibility. And that’s kind of been the way that I think the company has been managed for quite a long time. And again, the culture is shifting. We’re in the midst of a culture shift right now, which is wonderful.
I still get that just nagging feeling in the back of my head that they just don’t care as long as I’m taking care of things, which I am, but then I don’t hear from them. And so it’s just this cycle of do they see me? Do they not? Are they recognizing what I’m doing? And when I ask my leader, she’s like, “Yes, they recognize what you’re doing. They appreciate it. They know that you’re a strong leader,” but it’s like I don’t ever hear that directly from them to be a hundred percent confident that, that’s true. So I worry that they don’t necessarily care how I’m doing things in my department, just that they’re getting done.
MURIEL WILKINS: That might be true. They might not care about the sausage making. They’ve got other things to worry about. They don’t really want to know the how. They just want to know the what.
ELSIE: Yes, exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so part of this, Elsie, I think is, it’s no different than if you go present to an audience. Rule 101 of doing a presentation is thinking about your audience and saying, why should they care?
ELSIE: Yeah, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And it’s not a criticism of you. It’s more a, oh okay, yes, I have something to offer, and now I’ve got to figure out how does that connect to their agenda. Because everybody has different agendas. And that’s okay. We all have different agendas. There is no rule that says I should care just because. I mean, that would be nice in an ideal world, but we’re not there.
So in the meantime, I think it’s finding that intersection between how you are contributing value and what they care about. And what I hear you saying is it kind of goes back to the beginning when you said you always feel like there’s more that needs to be done. It strikes me that you are defining your value as getting things done. There’s a productivity element to it or solving the issue before anybody even knows about it. And what they care about is that the issue is dealt with, crisis averted. It’s not to take away from what you’re doing. I just think you need to present it and speak it at their level, which is not in the action steps. It is at the crisis element, whether crisis coming or crisis averted.
ELSIE: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: So tell me what you’re hearing here.
ELSIE: I’m hearing that I need to tailor these conversations to what I perceive them to care about, and I have a couple of ideas around that already. I’m not following the, I tie my value to productivity statement. Can you help me with that one?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, yeah. So when I say that, when I talk about productivity, it’s your to-do list, right?
ELSIE: Right, right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s the what did we do to get to the point where we averted the crisis? So it’s starting with the action steps rather than the outcome. The outcome is crisis averted.
ELSIE: Okay. Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s not dismissing what was done, but what I’m hearing in terms of what you’re saying is important to the senior executives is not so much what did you do to avert the crisis.
ELSIE: Got you.
MURIEL WILKINS: They’re not interested in the to-do list and the action steps. They’re interested in the prize at the end. Did we win it, or did we not? And so that has to be your starting point if you want to speak their language. Does that make sense?
ELSIE: Okay. That does make sense. Yes. And the wheel’s already turning. Okay. Hear you say that.
MURIEL WILKINS: And by the way, if you had come in today and said, “Oh, I tend to go in and sort of tell them, ’Oh, it’s taken care of, don’t worry about it.’ And they’re like, ’No, show us the spreadsheet, and we want to know what steps you took, and did you think about this, and we want to get into it and workshop it,’” then it would be the other way around.
ELSIE: Yeah, okay. They don’t want that. They don’t want another spreadsheet.
MURIEL WILKINS: So what I’m hearing is that you’re actually adding value in a way that they want, which is you’re getting rid of problems, but you’re not communicating it in a way that they could understand that that’s what you’re doing, for two reasons. One is you’re not in the room to communicate it, and two is when you are in the room, how are you communicating it?
ELSIE: Not the way they want to hear it.
MURIEL WILKINS:
How does that feel for you that that’s the way they want to hear it? Hypothetically because they’re not in front of me.
ELSIE: I can see where it makes sense, especially to someone who has a lot of other departments to manage and a company to run and budgets to figure out, so I can understand where it’s good to just know you have a strong leader leading this department, and I just want to know that things are going well. I guess my assumption was that they should notice that and then recognize my efforts, whereas I think I need to bring it to their attention that, hey, we’ve been more productive in this category over the last six months because I’ve done X, Y, and Z and make them recognize me, if that makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, should they maybe? Yeah, it would be nice if they did. Absolutely. It would be really nice if they did. And guess what? That’s something you’ll be able to do for your team members. Or when you’re in senior leadership, you’ll make sure you recognize and point people out. But the reality of it is, they aren’t, at least from what you’ve shared. So the choices, as you said, to sort of sit and wait for them to do that…
ELSIE: It’s not working.
MURIEL WILKINS: Or to put it in front of them and then see what happens. Do they value it, or do they not?
ELSIE: Can I ask you a question? And I know you don’t know these individuals, but is it too much to ask? Because again, I’m being told by my leader that they do recognize and appreciate it. I just don’t hear about it. Is it too much to ask them to say, “Hey, I hear that you think I’m doing a good job, or you’re telling me now that I’m coming to you, that I’m doing a good job? Could you every once in a while check in with me and just say, ’Hey, great job. I see these metrics improve this month, or something like that.’” Or is it, should I just focus on what I can control, and what I can do and not even ask the question?
MURIEL WILKINS: It seems Elsie is frustrated not just by the behavior of her colleague and the tension she feels from it, but also by her own lack of clarity as to whether the higher ups at the organization recognize her work. It’s a common desire to want your work to speak for itself, but the reality is that may not be enough to get people’s attention. Sometimes you’ve got to tell them. For Elsie, a lack of direct connection and feedback from the leaders of her organization are making it harder to know if what she’s doing matters, and therefore she’s questioning whether she matters.
We’ve now reached a point in the coaching session where Elsie has asked me a direct question about what her right next steps should be, and whether she’s overstepping her bounds. But my validating her need to know what to do would not be helping her. So instead, in an effort to have her exercise her own agency, I answer her question with a question and volley the ball back into her court to help her answer it for herself.
So let me ask you a question. What is wanting you to want them to take the initiative?
ELSIE: Oh, that is a good question. I think it’s one of my love languages. I think those words of affirmation really help me, and I think it stems from me being somewhat more quiet, I don’t want to say closed off, but I do my job, I do it quietly, and I just kind of move on. I’m not looking for praise and put me on the billboards all the time, but doing that day in, day out and working as hard as I do and not having any recognition for that, it’s just not great. But I mean, if you think or say that they have no obligation to do that, and I need to be the one to come to them and ask for that or present that, that’s reasonable too.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I mean, that’s not what I’m saying. I am not saying that they have no obligation. I don’t know if they have an obligation or not. What I’m saying is they’ve kind of shown you who they are. It kind of goes back to one of the greatest wisdom teachers of them all, Maya Angelou, who said, if they show you who they are, believe them.
And I know it feels, I’m looking at your face, it feels icky. We’re scrunching up our faces like, oh, this isn’t the way we want it to be, and yet it is. Could you ask them to do that? Absolutely. Does it mean that they will? I don’t know.
And so I think the question for me is, at this point right now, who do you trust more to get you closer to your goal of getting those words of affirmation, you going and showing and saying, “Okay, here’s what I did. What do you think?” Or you waiting for them to take the initiative to say, “Oh, I see what you did. Now let me come and give it to you?”
ELSIE: I need to go to them and ask for it, essentially, or ask for it by presenting them the information and the outcomes that I’ve achieved.
MURIEL WILKINS: And by the way, Elsie, I don’t think this has anything to do with being loud or quiet. You haven’t heard me mention those words at all.
ELSIE: I hear them a lot, so I think that’s why they’re top of mind for me.
MURIEL WILKINS: I understand that’s how people sort of project things. They like to put things in buckets, loud or quiet, right?
ELSIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Asking for recognition does not mean being loud, or presenting, advocating, making visible what it is that you do does not equate being loud. It’s just showing how you add value and then asking, “Here’s what I did. What do you think about what I did?”
ELSIE: Yeah, I think I can do that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can do that. Great, great.
ELSIE: I think I can do it. I got to try it first.
MURIEL WILKINS: You can try it.
ELSIE: Yes, I can.
MURIEL WILKINS: So that would be going to them. And then there’s the second element, which is your manager who has sort of been your representative, ambassador. And so tell me what you think could happen in that dynamic that would benefit you more in terms of showing up as being qualified for this next level position.
ELSIE:
Well, from my conversations with her, she believes I’m already well on my way to positioning myself for that. So I don’t know that I feel a roadblock there. I have a great sponsor in her. She though does recognize the executive team just happens to notice other individuals for other reasons more so than me. So she’s gently told me, “You need to speak up more,” I guess to put it lightly. But then she also, like I said earlier, I think she tries to protect me in some ways.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Yeah.
ELSIE: I think I might need to be more direct with her and say, “I appreciate what you’re doing, but I need to let me have the opportunity to say or report some of these things,” because I don’t ever want to feel like I’m going around her by any means. But she has been wonderfully supportive.
MURIEL WILKINS: So when you have somebody who supports you like that, yes, you go and say, “Hey, I appreciate what you’re doing, and here’s how I think you can support me even more.”
ELSIE: Okay. She would be open to that for sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: Can we try it? Not sure if it’s going to work because you’re basically responding to the advice that she gave you. This is not any different than the conversation we just had about using the language. Okay, something just came to me. You’re learning everybody’s love languages.
ELSIE: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
ELSIE: There’s so many.
MURIEL WILKINS: Your love language is words of affirmation. The senior executives love language is results, crisis averted. And then your sponsor, your manager, love language is I want to let you fly, but please be careful. I’m going to try to protect you. And so you have to sort of approach it in that way. “You’re the one who told me that I’ve got to be careful up there how things are done, but I need to put myself more forward. And at the same time, you don’t want me to get negative results. So can we come up with a strategy on how to get me in front of these folks more?” So engage her in the process.
ELSIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
ELSIE: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay?
ELSIE: Makes me feel less nervous about doing it on my own.
MURIEL WILKINS: Makes you feel my own feel less nervous. Yeah. I’m liking this idea of different love languages. I don’t think I’ve ever talked about love languages in the workplace, but here we are. So the question still remains, how do you get your love language met?
ELSIE: Yes. I think I have to ask for it. I think I have to be confident and bold enough to ask for it and bring these outcomes and say, “Here’s what I did. What do you think?”
MURIEL WILKINS: What do you think? Exactly.
ELSIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. What do you think? And may I make an additional suggestion? I think you sort of need to give it to yourself.
ELSIE: More words of affirmation to myself?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
ELSIE: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: What would that sound like?
ELSIE: Oh, gosh.
MURIEL WILKINS: In this context.
ELSIE: That’s tough. I think allowing myself to feel successful and reflect back on the journey that I’ve had so far, and not always feel like I have to have my eyes on the next project or prize or problem in front of me. Just allowing myself time and space to appreciate what I’ve done and how far I’ve come and the successes I have had. That’s tough.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s tough about it?
ELSIE: I don’t know where this comes from, but I just feel the need to work so hard all the time, and I don’t even know whose approval I’m seeking. I think it’s mostly internal that I don’t know why I can’t just appreciate, and everyone outside of me tells me all the time, except for these executives, how well I’ve done just in life and career and family. And I have such a hard time seeing it myself. I’m not sure why.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I don’t know why either, right? But you’ve articulated something that’s important and the reason it’s important is look where you are in your career and where you’re headed. If you can’t be your own cheerleader, your colleague over there is, the external words of affirmation become lesser and lesser.
ELSIE: Yeah, okay. You’re right.
MURIEL WILKINS: So perhaps, this is hypothetically, perhaps the senior executives who are not giving you that are the very situation that you need in order to learn how to give it to yourself.
ELSIE: That would help, I think.
MURIEL WILKINS: And to put it into real business terms, this is about, if we go away from the words of affirmation, it’s like, “Do you believe in the value that you bring?” Can you go to sleep at night and say, “Yeah, I’m doing a good job and I know what I can do. I might not be all the way yet there yet, but I do believe that I can do it even though I may not have achieved it.”
ELSIE: That’s heavy stuff. That’s heavy stuff.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
ELSIE: Believe it or not, I’ve improved my self-confidence that used to be a lot worse. So it’s a work in progress, but.
MURIEL WILKINS: yeah, look, I don’t think there’s a dashboard for confidence, right?
ELSIE: If only there’s a pill or something you could take.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t think there’s a trophy of, “We’re the wins.” I think what you’re just noticing is that, “Oh, this, me believing in what I’m doing and believing that what everybody else is saying about me is actually true.”
ELSIE: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: In order for me to be able to go in that room and authentically say it, not loudly, say it, not quietly say it-
ELSIE: Just say it.
MURIEL WILKINS: … If I want to expect it from others, then I need to expect it from myself it, and giving yourself some grace when it doesn’t happen.
ELSIE: Yeah, that too. I’m very hard on myself.
MURIEL WILKINS: But I loved your suggestion of you. Yeah, let me take a look at my track record. When you look at your track record, what story does it tell you?
ELSIE: That I started with little to nothing and built a life, a family, a career that I’m very proud of based on where I came from. And I just forget to sit down and remember that sometimes I think I’m always looking for that next prize in the sky. It’ll be interesting if I ever do reach a VP level, if that’ll be enough for me, because is that the top of the mountain or is there more to be had? I’m not sure yet.
MURIEL WILKINS: Not sure yet. I think that’s part of what you need to sit with.
ELSIE: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: Is it possible to have it not be one or the other? Meaning, I can look at what I’ve done and be proud about it and say, wow, look at where I am. And oh, that VP position looks quite nice.
ELSIE: Yes, yes. It’s that balance.
MURIEL WILKINS: But that VP position doesn’t mean that what I have done is not good enough.
ELSIE: That is true.
MURIEL WILKINS: So there’s something around, I think it’s the conviction, right? And what’s conviction? It’s belief in what you have done and what you bring to the table.
ELSIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And if you don’t believe in what you bring to the table, it’s very hard to have others believe it. In your case. I think they believe it. You’re just not hearing it back. But that might just be a I don’t know if that’s a function of you.
ELSIE: Probably not, but it doesn’t help me when I don’t hear it, so I need to ask for it. And I do think that might help me in my own self-confidence journey, because if I have to present it, then I have to think about it, and I have to make a case for why this was successful and I was responsible for it. I think I’m focused daily on just the next crisis that I have to solve.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, of course, because it goes-
ELSIE: Those wins just aren’t, it’s like, “great, I succeeded and I got to move on to the next one.”
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. Because it keeps you from being able to sit and say, “Oh, wow, what I’ve done is actually pretty good.”
ELSIE: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: I would suggest that there’s a and here. It’s not one or the other. And in the spirit of the, and I think this is, there’s a both yes, “I’m not going to say, oh, no, no, no. You shouldn’t want to get recognition from others.” You work with others. So you’re going to do that ask, and it’s very interesting to me that you use the word self-confidence because there’s the word self, and so self-confidence has nothing to do with anyone else.
I’m not in a position where I can unpack that for you because that’s not my profession.
ELSIE: No, I’m working on it, I promise.
MURIEL WILKINS: And that’s fine, right? It’s the awareness around it and how it’s playing out in this forum. So very interesting that for some time we haven’t even talked about the person who shall not be named.ELSIE:
I was hoping that would happen, to be honest, because that’s what I need to do, is I need to let him be him, do what I do best, and as we talked about, I just need to be more vocal about it and not worry about what’s going on in the background or behind my back, I guess.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. So that’s the rising above.
ELSIE: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right?
ELSIE: And that’s ultimately what I need to do.
MURIEL WILKINS: All right, so I feel like you have some action steps.
ELSIE: I absolutely do, yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So I think we can wrap it up. So tell me, how are you feeling now versus how you felt when we first got started?
ELSIE: I’m feeling much more optimistic and I have a plan, which I love planning, so having a plan really helps me. And I love that most of our conversation did not focus around an individual. It’s really about me and what I need to do to reach the level that I’m looking for. So much more optimistic.
MURIEL WILKINS: At the end of the day, that’s all we have control over, really, to a certain extent even, right, is ourselves.
ELSIE: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: And so I think whenever you’re feeling stuck in the future or you’re coming back to this frustration, the disappointment, I actually think what would be helpful for you is to sort of take that moment and say, “How can I express the love language that I feel like I’m missing from others to myself?” In whatever way you need to, and that’ll be bringing it back to you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to use love languages in coaching for the first time.
ELSIE: I honestly use that a lot, and I think about it a lot. In management, you can’t manage everybody the same. You have to speak to what speaks to them, so.
MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely. Well, thank you.
ELSIE: Yeah, thank you. This has been wonderful.
MURIEL WILKINS: By the end of our coaching conversation, Elsie realized that rising above the competition within herself was essential to navigating the dynamics with her peer and senior leadership. Sometimes, in fact, most times, the roadblocks we face are meant to teach us the very thing we need to learn to be able to get ahead. In Elsie’s case, knowing that she’s doing good work and yet not getting that recognition from leadership that she feels she needs was an opportunity to explore what it means to lead herself. This would require her to acknowledge and recognize the value she brings, and thereby building her own self-confidence first before asking for it from others.
That is not to say that recognition from others is not important. Of course it is. But there’s a difference between needing it to make you feel confident versus wanting it because you feel worthy of it. And that small nuance can make all the difference in how you advocate for yourself regardless of your style and the circumstances around you. That’s it for this episode of

Episode 5: How Do I Co-Lead with a Challenging Partner?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders, part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a long-time executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease.
I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Stephan to protect his confidentiality. He’s in a leadership role that he finds both interesting and challenging.
STEPHAN: It’s dealing with people, ultimately. It’s resolving problems. It’s making impact on completely different area. Not solving clients’ internal or external problems with whatever kind of design, but with dealing with people with emotions, with conflicts and trying to resolve it, trying to find common grounds, contributing in a really different way. This is my, I would say, first serious… Not that previous leading roles were not serious, but this one is most serious. More serious. Let’s say the team is bigger and the challenges are bigger.
MURIEL WILKINS: Stephan reached out because while he likes many aspects of his position, he’s having trouble co-leading a project with a partner who happens to be external to the company. We’ll start by getting a bit more of the lay of the land to better understand the issue he’s facing.
STEPHAN: I am experiencing something that I would call like dual leadership challenge. I am internal manager at my company, and this company has an external agency that is asked to complete the project. This agency has a very skilled and really great product lead who is basically in the same role as I am. So we have the situation of literally dual leadership, and in some moments this leads to misunderstandings.
It’s a little bit conflict of authority, like who actually rides the car, who wears pants in this relationship. It’s been really difficult to me to navigate. And additional flavor to it is what you usually meet from stakeholders is just constant criticism because people never like stuff. I mean, they say, “Yeah, it’s nice, but if we make this button green or if we make this button red, what do you think?”
And part of you has to be made of stone that you deal with this negative feedback. And it’s often just negative for being negative, but they cannot give you actual argument. Then you give them 20 arguments and then they say, “Ah, okay. Yeah, you’re right.” So that’s additional challenge to it. And there is yet another layer I would say. My counterpart, he has a very strong personality.
I believe I am a strong personality too, but in a different way. I am more influencer so that in span of time I can build coalition and convince people to my view, while my partner is just saying what he thinks and that’s the right idea, that’s the right direction, and here we go, which is not my approach to life in general. So that’s another layer of challenge.
MURIEL WILKINS: I like the way that you framed this in terms of under the umbrella of dual leadership. And under that umbrella, there’s a couple of components, or what I’m hearing as, correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m sort of hearing them as pain points for you, right?
STEPHAN: Yeah. Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: One being, as you put it, who wears the pants in this relationship, right? There’s a little bit of conflict of authority, like who’s in charge. The second being the notion of just design and the tension that’s held there in terms of it being a place where everybody has an opinion, and how do you get through those? And by the way, I’m probably very guilty of being the person who’s like, “Oh, I don’t like that color. Can you turn it green?” Because I think I know something about design. Literally I feel seen when you said that, and I will try better next time.
STEPHAN: It’s nothing bad in that. It’s nothing bad.
MURIEL WILKINS: But I’m holding empathy for the person who just redesigned my website because literally they went through weeks of me being that way. So thank you for that.
STEPHAN: We have first successful discussion.
MURIEL WILKINS: And then the other part that I’m hearing as a pain point is just a difference in two different types of strong personality. I see it as two different approaches that the two of you have. Does that sort of describe what you are experiencing?
STEPHAN: Yes. Yes, exactly. That’s it. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And on a scale from one to 10, with one being I feel it a little bit, when you go to the doctor, they’re like, how bad does it hurt? One is I kind of feel it, but it’s not a big deal. 10 is like, oh my gosh, excruciating. We need to operate now, doctor. Where are you on these pain points collectively? What does it feel like right now?
STEPHAN: Collectively?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: Five point something, so not really that bad.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. All right. Is there one pain point that is sorer than the other?
STEPHAN: One and three are the drivers.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So the conflict of authority and the difference in personality approaches.
STEPHAN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And where would you put those?
STEPHAN: I would say who’s in charge, it’s eight-ish, and personalities may be a little less like seven, but also it is maybe we don’t need to operate now, but certainly we need antibiotics.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, you need antibiotics. I hear you. And I’m just asking because I want to gauge. I’m not in your body. I’m not sitting in your chair. I don’t know how you’re experiencing this, but it gives me a level of how you’re experiencing it, what it feels like to you. So help me understand what dual leadership means to you.
STEPHAN: So on the one hand is who makes the final decision, actually what we do. If we have three competing ideas, who makes the final decision? Who is accountable? Who takes the responsibility? Or maybe these are two different things. Who makes decision and who is responsible? Because from people who are internal in our organization, I’m hearing that I am accountable for this design stuff, which is right to certain point.
But on the other hand, sometimes and very often these decisions are not taken by myself. And these decisions just happen, which sometimes I’m informed. Sometimes I have to dig very deep to learn that decisions were made. So the level of actual execution for one and two I would say for responsibility.
MURIEL WILKINS: And when you talk about execution and responsibility, help me clarify the difference between the two. You said execution and you said responsibility. When you’re talking about responsibility, it’s responsibility for what? And how is that different than being responsible for the execution?
STEPHAN: In execution, I mean that who makes the actual decision that this button should be blue or green. Of course, everyone has opinion, but which opinion is the major one? Which opinion we use? What’s the right solution? And as you may imagine in the design, I mean, there are better solutions and worse solutions, but there is no Bible that says, “Do this. Don’t do that.”
And the other thing is actual responsibility. So taking responsibility for the entire product that is happening, whether this will work or not in longer perspective. So if we’ll lose 20% customers over three years because of these little bricks of these decisions that were made beyond my control, I would be accountable that we lose these customers because of these pain points. Is this clear?
MURIEL WILKINS: It was clear from the beginning. It was just more having to me understand it. I’m positive you were being very clear. So when I asked you what does dual leadership mean to you, you pointed out this notion of who makes the final decision, who’s responsible, who’s accountable. And you were very quick, which I think is important to discern between maybe there’s a difference between responsibility and accountability and even decision-making and accountability.
The level of execution we just spoke about. And these are all parameters around the different scopes of leadership, particularly around a project or a deliverable. To what extent is the person that you’re co-leading with, and I know he’s not here, so I want to be fair, so this isn’t more from your perspective, to what extent if he were here, if I asked him what his definition of dual leadership is, would it be similar or different than yours?
STEPHAN: I think there is no dual leadership in his world.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay.
STEPHAN: So officially he’s the leader. End of the story.
MURIEL WILKINS: According to him is how you experience it.
STEPHAN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And so what gives you that sense using the same frame that you gave me around decision-making, accountability, responsibility, et cetera?
STEPHAN: It’s because of simply of the amount of decisions taken. 78 or 85% of decisions are made by him, sometimes including my view, sometimes not, which it’s fine.
MURIEL WILKINS: What makes it fine?
STEPHAN: Having different opinions. I mean, that’s what I mean only on this very exclusive meaning that having different opinions is fine.
MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, I’m asking because on the one hand you said, “Oh, he’s making decisions on his own and that’s not dual leadership.” But then as you explained it, you said, “Oh, but I guess it’s fine.” So I’m just asking what are you fine with and what are you not fine with?
STEPHAN: Sorry, sorry. So no, yeah, I’m fine with having different views and having my advice being taken into account or not, because that’s the nature of the job. What is not okay is these decisions are made without me. I was not there. And at first, yes, some time ago I thought it’s maybe only the case of communication, but it’s not the case of communication. It’s for me the statement of power, who really leads the project. So this is just one project that I’m responsible for. There are other projects where I take my decisions, where I am leading, and that’s fine.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Stephan, what I’m sitting with right now is, again, there was a reason I latched onto dual leadership, which I’m imagining dual is co-leading. There’s two people leading. And that’s the intent or the way this project is structured. And you said the issue is that the power seems to only lie with one in terms of making the decision. So what are we solving for here? And let me give you a couple of options. Are we solving for who should make the decision? It has to be one or the other. Or are we solving for what does decision making look like in a dual leadership structure?
STEPHAN: Point two.
MURIEL WILKINS: Point two? Okay. Why do you say… And I’m not saying one is better than the other. I’m just saying there’s different ways of approaching it. So tell me why point two for you?
STEPHAN: I think that what we have, what is given is the situation as it is. And of course, we can spend energy and time to try to get rid of him. I mean, that’s valid option too, right? But it’s really not what I would like to do. So if that’s the structure that organization thinks works fine, I have my opinion on that, that it’s not the best option, which has been voiced, which has been heard, and that’s it.
So I feel that I have to just deal with that, that that’s the given situation. And either I give up and everything is in his hands and then I am accountable for whatever errors or successes happen, or I just pull myself together and just try to do something and contribute to this decision-making process in dual leadership situation.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I think I have a picture of what it would look like to just say, “You know what? I’m just going to let this person make the decisions. Let me say a prayer and hope that it all works out for the best. Inshallah, right? Or/and the other scenario that you’re proposing is, okay, is there a way that I can actually try to contribute to these decisions?
STEPHAN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, if you followed the way of trying to contribute to the decisions, what have you tried so far, before we try to figure out what you could do, and if you should? What have you tried so far on that realm?
STEPHAN: Make an opinion, to have an opinion. To have an opinion, that’s one thing. What have I tried? Yeah, that’s the question. Because on the one hand I feel I tried everything, but when you tell me, so give me five items on this list of everything, the sheet is empty.
MURIEL WILKINS: I appreciate the honesty here.
STEPHAN: What I’ve done, literally everything, basically. So, my strategy, it seems it was just not having any strategy, just trying to be just yet another person who comes and says, change this button to red.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So, you are meeting it by saying, hey, let me just make sure my voice is heard.
STEPHAN: Mm-hmm.
MURIEL WILKINS: All right, let’s pause for a moment. We’ve heard Stephan lay out his dual leadership dilemma, sharing the reins of a design project with an outside partner, never quite knowing who’s steering. He’s grappling with unclear decision rights, feeling the pull of two different personalities, and wondering where he fits in when the authority feels uneven. What I’m noticing is how these elements weave together, foggy accountability, imbalanced power, and overlapping styles. It’s like watching two voices trying to harmonize without a written score, things get noisy and the melody falters. And Stephan is also realizing that he’s gotten bogged down by the frustration of working in this way, and as a result hasn’t done much to try to resolve it, and that it was now time to try something different. But before he can do that, we have to further identify where the breakdown is happening between him and his co-lead, otherwise his actions may be misdirected. That’s where we pick things back up, taking a closer look at where Stephan and his partner are out of sync.
There’s a couple of things here, right? I think whenever there’s a breakdown in a partnership, or in a team, or a relational, work relational piece, there are many variables to look at. But two of the ones that I think are helpful to look at to start with, to try to understand where the breakdown is, is it a content breakdown, meaning there’s misalignment around what we’re dealing with, or is it a process breakdown? And the process breakdown is the how. Like, yes, we both understand that this is the deliverable that needs to be met, that’s the content, there’s other parts of content that we can talk about, and then the process breakdown is, but there is dissonance, misalignment on the how, how we’re going to get there. And when it comes to decision making, decision making does consist of both of those variables. What are we making a decision on? That’s the content. And how are we getting to that decision? That’s the process.
And so, whenever… By the way, I face this all the time, it doesn’t even have work. Think about every time I can think about my own life, I think I live this every single day with some of the people in my household. But I thought this was going to happen, no, that was going to happen, you can peel back the onion and say, well, where was the misalignment? And so, when you look at this particular co-leadership structure, or co-leadership whatever we want to call it, where is the misalignment?
STEPHAN: So, basically, the misalignment is more, I would say, in the how, more in the process.
MURIEL WILKINS: More in the process. Okay.
STEPHAN: Whatever happens, his position has end, so his contractor. So, whatever happens in one year, two years, five years, four years, he’ll be gone because the contract is done. So, the problem will just cease to exist on its own. But I certainly don’t want to wait to this moment, I just want to do something about that. But within this framework, what and how it’s, I would say, 70 to 30% on the how.
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm. So, we’ll talk a little bit about that. So, you’re feeling it in the how. I also sense based on what you just said, that there is that 20 to 30% on the what, because, as you put it, when the contract is over for the contractor, they’re out of here, right?
STEPHAN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: They’re not held accountable for what happens, as you put it, three to four years from now. And so, there’s a question for me around is there true alignment around what success looks like for the project? Not just in the short term, but in the long term, which is a content question.
STEPHAN: That’s really, really the point, because I perceive it that this is maybe not the conflict of interest, but his organization has its goals and my organization has its own goals. And in this project I feel we have different goals. So, there is this misalignment, but it’s like three steps back. So, their goal is to be as long as possible with us because we support them, and we want to get rid of them as soon as possible because they’re pure costs. Yeah? Investment in a sense, but at this point, today, huge cost. So, yes, let me change it to 35, 40.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. It’s a little bit of both, right? And it often is, but I think-
STEPHAN: But still more of how, I would say, still a little more of how.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And I think what you pointed out around the green button, and it’s really multi-layers down where the dissonance is, what’s interesting is when there is that misalignment, whether it’s around the goals, as you put it, the long-term goals, the how, the way that it manifests itself is in the green buttons. Instead of talking about, oh my goodness, we’re actually not aligned around the goals, or we’re not aligned around process, we talk about should it be a green or a blue button, because it’s easier to grasp on, or we boil it down to, I’m going to go back to the beginning of our conversation, we boil it down to, it’s a difference in personalities.
STEPHAN:
Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, because that’s easier to point to. So, I think really the question here is, is there any opportunity to get greater alignment with this individual, so that it increases the score of dual leadership? Because one thing I know for sure when you are dealing with dual leadership, co-leadership, alignment is paramount. And alignment does not mean that there cannot be differences. There can be differences, all it means is that there is some intersection. So, when you point out their organizational goals are to keep the job, your organizational goals is to put them out of a job, those are the differences, but then where’s the intersection? Where’s the commonality? And can we find common ground there? If it exists.
Because as long as there is not something that exists that anchors the two of you together, where you can actually build the foundation of trust that, hey, at the end of the day, I know that we are both working towards this common goal, and we have that common goal in the best interest, there’s always going to be this feeling of divergent leadership rather than dual leadership. So, I just said a lot, let me pause there and see how that sits with you.
STEPHAN: Yeah. To be completely honest, that’s the moment that I desire from this conversation, that you really framed it as the case of trust that is behind everything, and it’s the foundation of everything. So, trust, yeah, it’s one thing. I tried to read some books on it, and just to also try to think of it, like from my perspective, what actually can I do? And I came across a book collaborating with enemy. Not that he’s enemy. And it’s super insightful that, yeah, you can have a conflict, you don’t have to resolve conflict, you can just have different views, and that’s fine. And even if that’s the way to collaborate with enemy, that’s okay, and that was a really eye-opening experience because I realized it really doesn’t have to be the actual driver, that’s fine.
And now, what you said, having this fundamental alignment based on trust is something that would really allow to have this dual and not divergent approach to it. Because ultimately we have a common goal. So, actually, maybe a solution would be really to focus on just delivering this. I know it sounds cliche, but that’s the point, just to deliver this thing, and maybe when we deliver and the project is finished, then we just seize the conflict.
MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, that’s certainly one way to go about it, right? In terms of what do you need to have trust on? What does the range of the common goal need to be? We’re not asking, you’re not making lifelong vows with this person, that-
STEPHAN: Correct.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s not about that. But I do think there’s a question around what are you contracting around? And that’s not clear to me. And it’s okay, it doesn’t matter, I don’t judge it. It could be, hey, all I need, I just need enough trust to get through this project. Or these contracts are going to be around for a while, there’s going to be the next project, next project, I want to make sure that we are building a relationship or rapport, a working relationship, where we can continue to get through without all these pain points that I’m feeling. But you have to scope it out, what’s the scope? And then you have to ensure that this individual who’s working, not even on the other side, but side by side with you, also understands that that’s the scope, that’s the alignment.
STEPHAN: Exactly. That’s right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: That’s right. And only now this [inaudible 00:27:41] that run away from me came back. So, this just a additional background information that he is almost two years longer in the project than myself. So, he’s organically more knowledgeable about all the kitchen of the project, of all people working, they are his colleagues from previous projects. So, I was new in the situation, so it took me some time to really pave my way into this society.
MURIEL WILKINS: And just for context, Stephan, was he leading on his own before you arriving or did he-
STEPHAN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: He was. Okay.
STEPHAN: Yeah, my post was empty.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So, I want to, because I think this is helpful in terms of figuring out alignment, I want you to put yourself in his shoes right now, put yourself in his shoes. What do you think is driving why he’s operating the way he is?
STEPHAN: At first, I would say just a very strong directive personality approach to everything. By everything, I mean whenever we go to, whatever, team building events, that he has the right opinion on, what should we do, when, and how. I just follow, I don’t care really that much, so that’s fine. But I think it’s just construction of personality at first. Wants to be smartest person in the room, to be sure that you are recognized for doing the best, stuff like that.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, those are all possibilities of what might be driving it, right? And I’m going to add one more, which is, he was the sole leader, so he was the sole decision maker, he was the one who was responsible, and I would assume to a certain extent, accountable, he was the only one who had to decide whether it was the green button or the blue button, and all of a sudden here you come on board.
STEPHAN: Correct.
MURIEL WILKINS: It reminds me of my sister, who is four years older than me. And I love her. We get along greatly. I have to preface this before I tell this story. But she tells a story about when I was born. She was like, “This is the worst day of my life.”
STEPHAN: Oh my gosh.
MURIEL WILKINS: Because up until then, guess what? She held that place of being the youngest in the family and all the things that come with that. And that position was then taken away.
STEPHAN: That might hurt, indeed.
MURIEL WILKINS: It might, it might not. But here’s the thing: I’m curious about whether he ever redefined what his position is in a dual leadership role and whether you defined what yours is in a dual leadership role. Did you all ever sit and define? And maybe you have. I don’t know.
STEPHAN: No, we haven’t.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. When we don’t define what the future needs to look like, what do we do? What do we tend to do?
STEPHAN: I think the basic idea was that I am also. But as I said, it’s one of the projects. So I am responsible, accountable for everything else and this one, and he sits on this one. I think because I also don’t know.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: I really feel exposed.
MURIEL WILKINS: Exposed. We both are, together. How about that? You exposed me on my design choices earlier. Okay. So what now? Let’s just take a pause here because I just want to hear from what you’re hearing, because I think you’re having some new level of awareness. What are some things that are in your control that you think you could… I don’t want to talk about the future just yet. That you think you could’ve done when you became co-lead, when it took this new structure? What are some of the things that are in your control that you think you could have done to try to increase the chances of there being an improved dual leadership experience? Not guarantee. Just increase the chances.
STEPHAN: Now I’m thinking that, in fact, basically I did nothing. Yeah. There was no one single meeting with my leadership, his leadership, him and me, just to sit and just write on piece of paper basically who does what. For instance, it was just we dived into stuff, into doing, doing, doing, doing, doing things.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: So that was really this first sin committed by Adam and Eve. So I think that could have been the issue. That’s never been defined.
MURIEL WILKINS: But in the spirit of the first sin committed by Adam and Eve, there was such a thing as grace and reconciliation.
STEPHAN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: I know enough. My mother would be very proud of me right now. So with that in mind, I mean look, I think if we want to get tactical here, I think you’ve pinned it. You went straight into doing without pulling back and saying, “Okay, what’s the plan? What’s the goal? What are the expectations here?” That’s the content part. And then what’s the how? And the how are things like, what’s our decision making process? You can use a tool, and you can look that up after our session, but use a tool like RACI. Mapping out who’s responsible, accountable, who needs to be consulted, who needs to be informed.
And what those types of conversations, and as you said, putting pen to paper does is it helps make the assumptions explicit so that then it can be discussed. If the assumptions are not the same. At least then you know what you’re disagreeing on, right?
STEPHAN: Correct. That’s the point, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: And you have guardrails. And here’s the thing: yes, you could just wait this person out. You could say, “You know what? Whatever the time period is, they’ll be gone and pain points will be relieved.” I guarantee you, Stephan, it will be a temporary relief because this notion of getting alignment with others is part of leadership. It’s just showing up in this particular contractor right now. But you will have other moments in your career where alignment is necessary, whether it be with your team, whether it be with peers, whether it be with your boss, whether it be with clients, whether it be with one other contractor.
STEPHAN: If you would ask me at the beginning of our conversation, on a scale of one to 10, what I think about alignment, I would say 12. So on theoretical level, that, I would put it as really the motto, the tagline, the first and most important thing. But when it actually came to do actual alignments, when we started collaboration, it didn’t happen.
MURIEL WILKINS: Now that we’ve unpacked Stephan’s story, a few things have come into focus. First, his frustration over who really calls the shots isn’t just a clash of styles. It’s a signal of deeper misalignment. And that misalignment, it traces back to the moment he first stepped into this role. It’s an important detail that we only got to once the conversation was well on its way, and it’s a dynamic that happens often because when teams reshuffle or new leaders come on board, we rarely hit the pause button to redefine who owns what.
Instead, we expect a productive dynamic to magically take shape. But the reality is, without an explicit conversation about decision rights, those tensions quietly simmer and the same issues keep resurfacing and even get worse over time. Now it’s time to explore how Stephan can move forward. Yes, he could simply wait and hope things improve on their own, but that feels unsustainable in the long run. Instead, we’ll look at the choices. He now has to reshape this dual leadership dynamic into one that’s more functional than it is today. So what do you think? Again, going back to your lane and what you can be 100% responsible for, because somebody could say, “Well, nobody else did it.” But they’re not sitting here. You’re sitting here.
And so I want to focus on what you contribute and can contribute moving forward to this dynamic, acknowledging that you’re not 100% responsible for the dynamic, but you are 50% responsible. And so with your 50%, where does this leave you in terms of what you think you can do moving forward?
STEPHAN: What I’m thinking now is the first thing I will not do or I would not like to do. I have to say, “Hey, man. Let’s sit together. Let’s make a new start. So let’s maybe not forget about the past or whatever. Just let’s sit and do it.” I would not like to do it because that would really look fake. Not honest, and also not in accordance with my true North compass. Yeah?
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
STEPHAN: So that wouldn’t be my goal. Just to think of some gradual tactics, how to smuggle these ideas into daily collaboration. And I think like 80% of success would be to have the structure in mind that it’s about what, how, and this trust that anchors both of us. And I think having this in mind is really 80% of the solution. And knowing, what is my 50% of influence, of power, in this? And 50% is actually a lot. Right?
MURIEL WILKINS: Mm-hmm.
STEPHAN: So basically the knowledge, the awareness. Awareness is the key to it.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And awareness is important. Awareness plus action is unstoppable. So how do you envision your awareness will turn into action? As a result of this awareness, what action do you think you’ll take?
STEPHAN: I’m thinking maybe what I just cannot resist is to think operationally, in actionable items, meaning I invent whatever, a new idea. New project, new tool, or a new approach to things we do. And just go to him and say, “Hey, here is my idea.” I mean like bigger idea. “Come on. Let’s do it.” And I will be the owner of this whatever, idea. That would certainly satisfy this appetite for ownership and responsibility. Maybe this would show that my contribution is not only opinion but actual action. This would also be opportunity to reverse the situation so that he would be forced, would be exposed to react to what is happening, because currently I am the one reacting to what is happening in most cases. Yeah? So this flipping the coin, maybe.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, flipping the coin. And the way that you’re describing it, Stephan, what’s coming up for me is the approach that you’re suggesting, it’s almost like a dance where you basically switch positions with him and so… but that doesn’t mean the dance changes. Okay?
The waltz is the waltz is the waltz. But that’s the question, is do both of you think you’re doing the waltz? And we still haven’t gotten that. And what you’re not describing to me in the way that I’m understanding it… again, check me if I’m off here. What you’re not describing to me is the spirit of the book that you refer to, which, the underlying word for me that I wrote down was collaboration. Because if you’re going to come up and say, “Hey, here’s my idea, and I’m doing it.” You’re basically saying, “Okay. Now I’m switching roles in the dance. I take the lead, you take the other.” Okay, but that’s not necessarily a collaboration. If you want to continue down the individual, I’m going to stand my ground, or he stands as ground, it has to be one or the other, it’s a zero-sum game, then that is an approach. But it’s not an alignment and collaboration approach.
STEPHAN: We changed dance room. But maybe just first ask what we dance, actually.
MURIEL WILKINS: And I hear your hesitation around… not even hesitation. You flat out said you’re not going to do it. You don’t want to sit down and have, as they call it sometimes, a come to Jesus conversation where it’s like, “Oh. And let’s wipe the slate clean. Da-da-da.”
STEPHAN: But maybe that’s the wrong approach. Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: What’s your hesitation there? What would make that type of conversation… let’s call it a clearing. A reset conversation is what it is. What would make that comfortable for you? Because you said it wouldn’t feel normal to you.
STEPHAN: Actually, to put it the way, what harm could it do? What would be the worst scenario if we have this conversation in next week?
MURIEL WILKINS: What would be the worst scenario?
STEPHAN: Yeah. I’m just trying to figure it out, but no, there is nothing that comes to my mind.
MURIEL WILKINS: I think you’d end up right where you already are.
STEPHAN: Yeah, exactly. So just to make a full U-turn. But maybe having this full U-turn. It’s not U-turn, it’s just full circle. Maybe during this conversation we would be able to actually stop at some point and not come back to the point of departure.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, you certainly wouldn’t come back to the point of departure because even if you have that and he does nothing, he’s like, “No. No, thank you.” What you will then have that you don’t have now is more evidence or less evidence or information. You will be more informed around, what is the possibility of getting closer to a dual leadership? You’ll have made the effort versus what you said happened at the beginning, which is you said nothing was done, right?
STEPHAN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So now you will have put in the effort, some effort.
STEPHAN: Because now I’m wondering why I just immediately said, “I don’t want to do it.” That’s interesting, why this came as a first idea to me, because it also stands in real opposition to collaboration spirit and alignment, because that’s the actual tool to achieve this goal. And I just thought it’s not the best way. So what’s the best way? Yeah. What’s the cost of it? Like one hour or two hours of time. And yeah, a little bit of this stress, tension, whatever, but…
MURIEL WILKINS: The risk is… I’m going to just call it out, or what I think, what’s my hypothesis. The risk is that that part of you who said, “This is what I don’t want to do. I’m not going to have that conversation because it doesn’t feel natural to me.” The risk is, if it doesn’t work out, that part of you comes back and says, “I told you so, Stephan. You wasted our damn time doing this. I told you it wasn’t going to work out!” The question is, if that were to happen, if whatever risk happens, would you be able to handle it?
STEPHAN: That’s the point. We’re really trying to process everything. My internal GPT. Yeah.
Really, that’s the point when you’re really confronted with the picture of yourself, with the image of yourself that your collaborative, whatever. That you value these things. When you really, on a silver plate, you are given the tool to do it, the first thing is resistance. Then after resistance comes hesitation. I still, although intellectually at this point, I’m sure we have to do it next week. When we finish, I’ll schedule a meeting. Yeah, I think it’s just coming back to personality traits, personality issues. I think that’s it. I think that’s it. That’s just personal preference/avoidance/whatever.
Part of me thinks this will be confrontation, which just by principle, I’m usually trying to avoid confrontation. Unless it’s really about super core values, like justice. Then I really fight. But when it’s not super core value, I’m flexible.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m glad you named it as personality preferences, versus this is just who I am. Because personality preference, I’m honing in on the word preference. Preference is subjective.
STEPHAN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: Preference is what you choose today.
STEPHAN: Correct.
MURIEL WILKINS: I don’t know about you, but there are times when … If you had asked me for years what’s my favorite ice cream, my preference is butter pecan. Then the other idea, I had some chocolate ice cream and I was like, “Oh! Maybe this is my preference now.” In fact, maybe sometimes I can have both. Okay, there is no rule that I have to just have one flavor of ice cream. There’s a reason why there are multiple flavors.
You, as a personality, are not monolithic. You have these different aspects. The preference is the one that we choose to lean on, or not even choose, we just do it because it’s habitual. I think what’s happening now, and at least the conversation today, what I’m seeing is you’re recognizing that yes, one preference is to not address conflict, or as you put it, avoid conflict. And there’s this other emerging desire for collaboration. Now the question to me and that you have to actualize is how do you enter this relationship, or reset, or bring a different energy to it where you’re holding both collaboration and how to deal with conflict. The two can co-exist.
STEPHAN: That’s really when you just wrote it on the paper, you have to address conflict and then to collaborate. That’s same goal. To collaborate means to address conflicts.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. There’s a fundamental leadership belief that you just articulated for yourself that will enable you to then approach this differently. Versus the belief that if there is conflict, there cannot be collaboration. It’s no a right or wrong belief, it just will lead to different results.
STEPHAN: Correct. That’s this really aha moment, that you just discovered something that was all the time, just in front of you. But for some reason, it was blurred behind. From preferences, or
assumptions, pre-judgements, whatever.
MURIEL WILKINS: For sure. It’s just a matter of readiness. Everything’s always right in front of us until we’re ready to see. There’s one of my favorite quotes, I might butcher it. But it’s like, “When the student is ready, the teacher appears.” I think in this situation, Stephan, you are both student and teacher. When it’s right in front of you, yeah, you’re ready to learn from yourself when you’re ready.
I want to bring this as a landing for you, picking up on something you said earlier, which is intellectually you’re getting it. Intellectually, it’s making sense and you’re going to schedule something with this colleague of yours. I think part of this is now not just intellectualizing it, but actually feeling it, which is why I’ve been pushing a little bit to action. How do you actually put this into reality? From up here, and I’m pointing to my head, to out there.
What I would encourage you to do, your homework is to schedule this, but what I would encourage you to do is between now and that meeting is to actually practice having this conversation. Write it out. What are you going to say? Then actually say it. The practice is not so that you get it right. The practice is so that it warms up in yourself. You’re doing a warmup. You’re feeling what it feels like before it’s actually happening. I just want to make sure you get that distinction. It’s not about so that the conversation is perfect and the sky’s open up-
STEPHAN: Sure.
MURIEL WILKINS: … and all of a sudden, you guys are the best collaborators in the world. It’s so that you can see that you can actually say those words, et cetera. Then that next stage is actually having the conversation with him.
STEPHAN: Yeah. I’m using this tool, but in different contexts of difficult conversations. Meaning asking supervisors or boss for something. Until you ask, the answer is no. But sometimes to actually ask, it is really a lot. These are the situations when I’m practicing it. It’s slightly different, but that’s excellent practice.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: That’s excellent approach.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
STEPHAN: Just to try to say it. When you hear yourself, there’s different channel of experience. “What? How did I say that? How is it possible?”
MURIEL WILKINS: This is extra credit. If you have anyone that you trust, one of your colleagues who knows this person, and they would be willing to role play it a little bit with you, that’s the extra punch.
STEPHAN: Oh, yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: That would be level three before you actually have the conversation.
STEPHAN: Oh, totally.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. I would love to hear, as we close, how are you feeling now versus how you did when we first got started?
STEPHAN: This dual feeling. On the one hand, I’m feeling complete dumb idiot. Actually, these are simple things. But I don’t know, not accessible, they’re hidden, whatever. On the other hand, what I feel is gratitude for this meeting that it’s really unveiled, uncovered these frameworks of understanding the process and what is going on. That gives me a really great, I don’t know, anchor maybe to navigate. Not anchor, lighthouse to navigate. Of course, finally, this meeting gives me the actual action points with scheduling the meeting and practicing the conversation. These three areas, that’s wow.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, that’s amazing, Stephan. I would say when you find yourself in a similar situation, whether it’s this one or a different one where there are pain points, take yourself back up to that lighthouse. Spend the time as you’re doing now just looking at, “Okay, let me look around and try to get an understanding of what is actually happening.” Because if you can understand what’s happening, then you can determine how do I move forward, how do I respond. Okay?
STEPHAN: Totally.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you. Thank you for your level of engagement in this.
STEPHAN: Thank you very much.
MURIEL WILKINS: Stephan came into his coaching session unsure about the dual leadership setup he was in, but he left with clarity on steps he can take to turn it around. And crucially, a commitment to own his part of the dynamic. He committed to set up that reset meeting and practice his approach, turning awareness into action. Stephan’s decision to take responsibility for his part is exactly what’s needed to make co-leading work. You can’t control the other person, but you can always control how you show up. When you own your part, whether that’s speaking up clearly, sharing expectations, or clarifying roles, you’re no longer just reacting to someone else’s moves. You’re actively shaping the conversation and relationship. When you take responsibility for your share of any conflict or collaboration, you shift the whole dynamic and that’s where real progress starts.

Flynn:  I became aware of a need to change. I realized, I was like, “Wait, I’m doing everything for everyone. Me leading this company more looks like me cleaning up everyone’s stuff.”

================================================================================
Episode 6: How Do I Adapt My Leadership as My Company Grows?
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: I am Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing.
Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Flynn to protect her confidentiality. She’s an entrepreneur and has led her business to a fair amount of success, but recently, she felt like things weren’t going as smoothly as they could, and she became frustrated with how effectively the company was running.
FLYNN: Basically, this started. I became aware of a need to change, and to be honest, it was a big birthday and it may coincide with what people call not a midlife crisis, it felt like a re-contemplation of things. And I realized, I was like, “Wait, I’m doing everything for everyone.” Me leading this company more looks like me cleaning up everyone’s stuff. I really took this all seriously. There’s a lot of things that need to be examined because I’m doing people’s work versus leading them to have their greatest success.
MURIEL WILKINS: Flynn even considered stepping away from the company, but while trying to sort out the issues she faced, she took steps to better develop herself and improve her leadership, and brought in some new team members.
FLYNN: I wanted to find stronger players. I actually worked with a headhunter and I filled some posts with stronger players. That was incredible because the type of people that came were very different than ones I had had in the past. The idea of where I was trying to get is really having people own their work. I have some great new people. Now we want to set this up for success, so I want to make sure I’m structuring my leadership in a new way where they’re doing their work. I’m not answering their questions so don’t come to me for everything.
MURIEL WILKINS: Now, Flynn wants to make sure she builds back better, putting her own leadership skills in check to avoid a situation where she can’t trust her team again. But first, I wanted to go back to the beginning to understand more about why she started her own business in the first place.
FLYNN: I’m from a world of entrepreneurs, so I’ve had businesses since I was seven on the bus making things that I sold to my friends, so starting a company is not something unusual, and everyone in my family is an entrepreneur. In my twenties, I had a job that didn’t pay very much, and on the side, I started a company which had a structure where I sold to clients that I had met during summer jobs as a student, and I did that on the weekends and it was very lucrative. That industry changed a little bit, and so I decided to go back to school. So I started, I went to design school. I did all the pattern making, did all the sewing, so that’s where we started. I’ve shifted as the environment has shifted, and it’s always been about quality and not spending money on things other than the quality.
We’ve developed ourselves into somewhat of a brand, but I’m finding that I probably need to invest in marketing now because I’ve been so under the radar that our clients come back and I’ve had most of them for the whole time we’ve been in business and we add, but we now need a new audience. And I’m not sure if I need to shift a little bit and look at where I’m spending my money, because I’ve gotten some coaches and they ask me to do things and I realized I’ve spent money there where I should look to myself as the expert. Like, “Why am I doing what you want to do?”
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, understood.
FLYNN: I need to be reading and figuring out what our core values are and go one step aside and do what I believe in. I give too much. I need to just stop all of that. I’m the boss and I actually know a lot, and I think I need to be more confident in my ideas, because I put money in these other people’s ideas and they really don’t know as much as I do.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Okay. All right, so we’re going to focus today on trying to figure out what your ideas are about the particular areas that you’re challenged with, and see if you can come to your own conclusions. I think that that’s a big part of coaching, is understanding what your answers are.
FLYNN: I’ve come to a lot of conclusions in basically writing down what I’m going to talk to you about and processing it and reprocessing it and reading these things, and it’s hilarious.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, there you go. This might end up being a very brief coaching meeting.
FLYNN: No, no, no, no, it won’t, because we can take it, but I just kind of like, what can I do on my own so that what I do with Muriel is going to be very helpful?
MURIEL WILKINS: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Okay, so now, it sounds like what’s happened is there was a period in time where you were finding some challenges with some of your team members. Those team members are no longer there. You now feel like you have a pretty good team or a very good team, and so the question is… Well, what’s the question as it relates to your… If you could say it in a one sentence question, what’s the question as it relates to your current team?
FLYNN: I think that there is still some repositioning of responsibilities where I see weakness in characters. How much do I have to worry about what they’re learning and getting? Has this environment really changed? Do I need to do the KPIs and what their goals are personally as well as the corporate goals? Because I feel like coming out of this experience, we’re in a whole new world of what people consider work to be.
MURIEL WILKINS: Consider work to be, okay. And so what I’m hearing from you is in what ways do you need to adapt, if any?
FLYNN: If any, and I think I’ve come up with some things. I want to hear if you support those or think that I don’t need to go that far.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, let me caveat that. Whether I support it, it’s very interesting because you just said, “I am paying all these people to give me ideas and I have to come up with. I realize, no, I know what’s right for my company and I can come up with my own answers.” And a few minutes later you said, “I want to know if you support those ideas.” So I think we’re going to, during this conversation, actually put into practice what you shared a few minutes ago, which is it really doesn’t matter whether I support the idea or not because I’m not the one running this business. You are. What we’ll do is maybe work through what your different options are, what are the different ways that you’re thinking about it, and are you coming to a conclusion or are you getting to a decision that is aligned with ultimately what you want for your team and your business? Because that’s all really that matters, is is there alignment? Are the decisions that you’re making aligned with what you want the outcome to be?
FLYNN: Agreed. And another thing that I’m really doing is trying to take control of my future, shall we say, because I think sometimes I’m going to have to be bold and do things that are uncomfortable. It’s my job to restructure things for success for the company.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So let’s take a step back, because what I heard you say is in what way do you need to lead any differently than you have? Do you need to lead a new way so that it adapts to the team that you have? Am I phrasing that right?
FLYNN: Mm-hmm. The leading in a new way really has to do with I used to finish people’s job and be very hands-on, and now I’m leading in a new way and telling them their responsibilities, setting KPIs and speaking to them about their successes, and also asking questions to try to get them to answer so they can grow and become independent in their work. And that’s been working very well. And also, I’ve been giving a lot more responsibility to people instead of micromanaging, and in fact, I’m finding that some people have a lot more talent than you realize and a lot more capabilities, and you also find that some people don’t.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. Okay. So what do you do in the situations where they don’t have the capabilities?
FLYNN: Exactly. What have I done? I tried to do a KPI review. I have not utilized that with all of my team, only where I saw issues. I think that I need to insert KPIs and speak to everyone at a certain cadence to make sure they’re growing and the company’s moving forward, which takes more work on my part to decide what they are, but I think I’m going to have to start putting that into action because the company’s stalled in growth a little bit, and I think they haven’t held people accountable enough.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. All right. So I think there’s an underlying question here, which is how do you set expectations and hold them accountable to those expectations with consistency and proactively, rather than wait until there’s a problem to then hold them accountable retroactively?
FLYNN: Agreed.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay?
FLYNN: That’s a great question. So, I think I need to spend time really outlining what success looks like in each position, which I have started to do. Where people are really performing to a high level, I guess the answer is I still need to do that. Correct?
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, let’s work through that. What do you have to gain and what do you have to lose by doing that across the board, regardless of what the current performance is in that role?
FLYNN: Thinking of one role, what you have to lose is that if someone really seems to be at a high level and I’ve been really happy with this person, I don’t want them to think I’m being overly judgmental when they are doing a very good job.
MURIEL WILKINS: And in what way are setting KPIs or setting expectations judgmental?
FLYNN: Maybe they’re not actually, because this person would like to know that they’re having success, so talking about the amount of sales coming from their work or the successes of different people, upon thinking about it, they would probably like that. I guess my thought was they might think I was judgy in a creative field, but I think you’re right. The person’s a professional, they really wouldn’t care.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. You’ve articulated the thought and I don’t know if that thought really serves you, right?
FLYNN: It doesn’t serve me.
MURIEL WILKINS: I only share expectations, or I only share whether it’s in the form of KPIs or any other way, or I only give feedback if the person’s not doing a good job. Is that necessarily true?
FLYNN: I share feedback on a more casual basis if it’s a good job, so I only hold meetings about these things when disaster is starting to occur.
MURIEL WILKINS: Got it. So, systems and processes don’t come into play unless.
FLYNN: A little bit, because if you’re going along well, you’re saying what they’re doing well as you go. It’s just I think the hard conversations, I think, I may be not be good at the hard stuff, so it piles up a little bit and then it becomes a more serious meeting. Does that make sense?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. I think it sounds to me that if I was a casual observer in your company and walking around the halls and hung around for a little bit, is that these conversations become an event rather than-
FLYNN: The hard ones.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. But the fact that you’re labeling them as hard rather than saying, “These are just conversations we need to be having consistently about what the expectations are. How are we meeting expectations? What’s working, what’s not working?” And keeping track of that. If that is happening consistently, it’s not a hard or easy conversation. It’s just a normal conversation to have, which by the way is what leads to holding people accountable.
FLYNN: I tend to keep track with numbers and Excels add then, comments on them, and then I think I should be sharing that information with the people, the different members of the team. So if I’m keeping track, to me, it looks more like a monthly meeting where you’re going over successes and areas of working too, because I’m writing it down somewhere, if that makes sense.. Versus casual, that was successful, good email. It should be more numeric and trackable.
MURIEL WILKINS: Flynn started her company at the ground level, and in part, because of that, she’s run into some of the pitfalls and ambiguity that comes with entrepreneurship, especially as the company grows. While she originally came to the coaching session with issues around underperforming employees, she was ready and willing to think about ways she could take responsibility for that performance and create better systems in the future. That’s a good first step, the desire to take accountability and to put in the work of thinking through ways to improve. In some ways, this is just a small slice of an issue that happens with so many leaders, being able to back away from the day-to-day crises, focusing on the product and services you’re selling, and thinking about how you can really scale up your leadership.
Sometimes as an entrepreneur, it’s even easier to stay in the weeds of doing the work yourself because you know it so well, and building systems to manage people can be really tricky. But Flynn is ready to take the first steps towards creating a better system, and while it is just one part of the issue she’s facing, I think it’ll be helpful to talk through it a bit more in depth to have her test out why and how she might move forward with a different kind of approach.
What it sounds like is in your mind, you are thinking,
Oh, if everything’s going good, I can keep it casual, and if things aren’t going good, I’ve got to create a process and structure.
And maybe in the spirit of what you said, how do you need to potentially structure your leadership in a new way? Maybe the new way is that there is no, This is what happens when things are good, and this is how I deal with things when things are bad. It’s more around how do I ensure that I am managing performance and managing deliverables consistently, and therefore, I’m having these meetings and I’m keeping track and I’m sharing feedback one way or the other with a regularity across all of my team members, regardless of where they are?
FLYNN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: What difference do you think that would make for you and for the team?
FLYNN: For me, I think it would be taking a bit more time to reflect and setting up structure around each person’s position, which is fine. And for the team, I think it creates a bit more equitability in my interaction with each of them because if I’m pulling people in who are not having success to go over and try to boost them and help them improve, then it feels like they’re being pulled into the teacher’s office a little bit, when if people are successful, I’m not having the same time with them in a formal meeting.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, it becomes an expectation of you in terms of the way that you lead them?
FLYNN: Yes, but I can see the success of that already. I also do think that me restructuring someone who’s not having success leading is an obvious thing to do, so I need to be comfortable shifting people’s positions as appropriate.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what is your level of comfort with doing that now?
FLYNN: I’ve been moving forward with that quite a bit recently. So if you had spoken to me last year before I had done all of this work, I would not have been comfortable with it, but I really have gotten very comfortable with it. And I think then the next question is how do we lead this company to more growth? And then the other thing is my needing to really look inward and think of my ideas, and maybe setting up a board of people and not sometimes I’m giving a little too much credit to the louder people.
MURIEL WILKINS: So you named something for you, which is around listening to the louder voices more in the room rather than to your own voice.
FLYNN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: I’m curious what that’s about.
FLYNN: I do think that I’m working on, personally, I’m a middle of five children and I have a very demanding family, and I think I’ve been very good at doing things very well to have success and never be the person who’s looked closely at. I had all straight A’s, A pluses, got into every university. I just was very good at, No one will bother me if I just get it done perfectly and then I can go on my merry way, whereas other people were pointed out and lauded at the dining table every night. So I think this keeping my head down has shaped the company a little bit, as being under the radar, and now if I want us to be bigger and more, it comes both in conversation with loud people and with what we do marketing-wise with the company, and I’m just going to have to get comfortable with that.
MURIEL WILKINS: And what would it take for you to get comfortable with that?
FLYNN: I just think I have to get out of my comfort zone, and I’m not sure how I do that exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, what would that look like? Let’s say tomorrow, you called me and you said, “Oh my God, Muriel, I got out of my comfort zone today. I kept my head up. I didn’t keep my head down. I had my head up.”
FLYNN: Oh, I’ve been practicing. I’ve been calling other people in the industry to get feedback. In the attempts to have growth, I’ve reached out to very interesting people. I guess the concern of a consultant is you’re taking the louder voice again and empowering them, but I just felt that I’ve been doing what I’ve been doing for 20 years and we haven’t grown enough. So as much as you want to listen to your own voice, you also want the wisdoms of people who have had great success, so that’s a balance I need to find.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I think that getting information from others is certainly helpful, and at the end of the day, recognizing that getting information from others isn’t necessarily going to give you the answer, and that the role that you’re in, the position that you’re in, ultimately, who drives the answer? Who makes the decision?
FLYNN: I make the decision, and I must say that I find that you do have listen to some of these experienced people for the right questions to ask. And if you are trying to examine, like I was examining how I was leading. I was following up and finishing people’s work, and just me holding back and challenging them to do their own work and being patient, and even worse, when you have maybe a little bit of perfectionism in you is watching them do it. Saying to yourself, okay, they’re not going to do it like I would do it, but I hired them to do a job and me finishing it doesn’t allow me to do my job, which is to review people, help them grow, ask them questions, challenge them, and think of how to bring the company forward. So you have to be okay with things not being done as you would do them, because that’s a hard thing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And so it sounds like you’re doing all the things in support of what you’re saying you want to do, which is listening to your own voice, being able to get out of your comfort zone, adding some structures and systems to your company. Now, is it hard?
FLYNN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: And that’s okay. Why shouldn’t it be hard?
FLYNN: True. Well, I’m trying to get some time back in my life because I’ve been working too much, and so to do all of that and to have time for the rest of your life is the big goal here. Because I think that I’ve put too much work in my life, so to be able to do this succinctly is the big question, so that you can live your fuller other parts of your life.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, that’s a big question for a lot of us, and it comes back down to the decisions you make. But it sounds like what you’re doing is trying to set yourself up so that it frees up some of the time that you were getting caught up in before, which is doing everything for everybody else.
FLYNN: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: So all the research you’re doing and working with external folks and having a team in place, developing your team, are all of those things in service also of you being able to free up some of your own time down the road?
FLYNN: Yeah, I’m getting there.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Well, what is the there?
FLYNN: There is when people really can do their own jobs and I’m not doing them for them, and I don’t feel like everything’s on my shoulders and that I have people that are more talented than me doing their areas of the company. Because when I was in the trenches more, once I started getting out of the trenches, I realized people weren’t doing what they were supposed to do and they were doing a lot of things incorrectly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So I would love for you to write down those things. People are doing their own job. You mentioned a few things. I would love for you to write them down as your own KPIs, and think about it in terms of, okay, if a year from now, all of those KPIs are met, what do I have to put in place between now and then that will move me closer to those goals? Because it’s not just going to, as you know, and I’m not suggesting that’s what you’re doing, but it’s not just going to magically happen. And so you’re taking initial steps to get there, but you have to keep track of it. You have to reassess. If you put a system in place, in a couple of months, look at the system. Is that actually working in a way that’s helping me not be as involved, or is there something else different that I have to try? So there is some trial and error with management, quite frankly.
FLYNN: Okay. The holding them accountable and staying on top of that when things are going well is easy to not stay on top of. And as far as leadership, I really need to get my hands around structuring good KPIs.
MURIEL WILKINS: I think I would start for you in terms of thinking around what are the expectations and objectives? What do I want each of these roles, regardless of who sits in them, to be able to achieve within a period of time, and why? Why are those the things that need to be achievable? It should be to serve something for the company. And then making sure that they are things that are realistic and that folks have the resources to be able to actually deliver on, and that are visible and measurable.
FLYNN: Okay.
MURIEL WILKINS: So I think be careful of getting wrapped up in the word KPI and think about it in terms of am I setting expectations? Didn’t people know what it is that they are ultimately responsible for, what success looks like, how they’re being measured? What outcomes are we driving to so that we can make sure that everybody’s moving in the same direction?
FLYNN: Okay, and staying on top of that.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, you’re right. So they need to stay consistent. They need to be looked at.
FLYNN: What is the timetable that you have a meeting like this? Is it monthly? Is it-
MURIEL WILKINS: I think it depends. Everybody’s different, so I think you have to look at your team and say what’s going to make the most sense for my team? Do I need it to be more frequent? Does it need to be one-on-one? Do we need to be doing this as a team? And this is kind of where it goes back to ultimately, you choose, and if you find that it’s not meeting the KPIs that you set for yourself around creating more time, making sure that they can make their own decisions, that they are moving accordingly to points, then you reassess. You say, “Oh, okay, we’ve been doing monthly meetings. Maybe we should be doing weekly meetings.” So there’s an adaptability that would be helpful, and yes, a formula to all of this certainly would be nice, but make sure you write that formula in pencil, because part of the skill of being able to be an effective leader is understanding that sometimes you have to change the formula as you’re working it, and that’s okay.
FLYNN: Okay. And I think for myself, saying no is something I have to do.
MURIEL WILKINS: No to what?
FLYNN: To some things that people request. I please a bit too much sometimes, because that then costs us money that we can’t spend on what I think our priorities are.
MURIEL WILKINS: So this is why knowing what’s important to you up front can help frame that. You have to have clarity around what’s important because that then helps drive what you say yes or no to.
FLYNN: Okay, and I have to remember that
MURIEL WILKINS: As Flynn thinks about what is next for her company, she wants to make sure she’s setting up the right systems to help her team succeed without her getting into the nitty-gritty details around everything. This is an essential skill of leadership, but it can be hard, and perhaps especially hard when you’re an entrepreneur who has built something from the ground up. As a leadership coach, part of what I help people do is step away from the numbers and metrics they might be focused on and take a step back to ask bigger questions, like what is the goal they are trying to achieve? One goal Flynn has is to be able to work at a higher level and still grow her business, so she needs to work through the structure she can put in place to hold people accountable without micromanaging.
One important thing to also note here is that organizational and personal change aren’t linear. If what is holding someone back from putting a new system in place is that it might not succeed, well, they aren’t going to get very far. Coming up with a new formula is great if it works to help Flynn move forward, but as I said, writing that formula in pencil, not pen, is also necessary, because part of true leadership is also being adaptable. Let’s jump back in as we explore what concrete steps come next for Flynn.
I think that a part of this is as we started off, you’re in the process of setting up these systems for yourself, and it sounds like you’re asking yourself all the right questions. At some point, it is about kind of just putting a stake in the ground and trying it. And then if it doesn’t work, it’s okay. As long as you notice that it’s not working, and then you go back and say, “How can I adapt it?” But I think really, this big piece around expectations for your staff is going to be important if you want to continue for them to be managing the way that they are, which sounds like they’re on a positive trajectory.
FLYNN: Yes. I just think I’m not pushing them forward enough or holding them accountable enough.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. And so, because I feel like this would be a good closing, now do you have a sense of how you could keep them accountable enough?
FLYNN: Well, I just need to sit down and really structure each person’s world. I just have to not be afraid to ask and be on people’s tail a little bit.
MURIEL WILKINS: What do you want to have happen?
FLYNN: I guess I need to just put down a firm deadline. This is when it has to be done by. And I know that sounds strange, but I always used to just stay here and do it with them, but I want it to be done without me. That’s why I’m paying you quite a bit to do this position.
MURIEL WILKINS: Tell me what it would sound like for you to be able to give her a definitive deadline as you just stated.
FLYNN: Then there’s, “Oh, it took longer than I thought it would take.” And then she’ll say, “But I want to do it myself.” This is the type of thing I’m hearing.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. And so ultimately then, who makes the call?
FLYNN: The call?
MURIEL WILKINS: Who makes the call to be able to meet the deadline that you want? How does it get resolved ultimately?
FLYNN: Oh, it hasn’t. Deadlines just don’t get met.
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay. So let’s imagine a scenario where the deadline does get met.
FLYNN: Then I say, “Please pull in this other person to help you with this project. You can’t do it yourself. It needs to get done.” It just has to get done, period. The end. That’s not an option.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. And so, is that something that you’re already doing, following that path?
FLYNN: No, but I will, and I like the suggestion. And the other thing that happens is things don’t get done well because there’s not enough oversight, which is how I was previously leading, because my attention was too much in the details and I wasn’t seeing that certain people weren’t doing their job.
MURIEL WILKINS: I want to make the discernment between the behavior you used to have, which is I do things for everyone, versus I need to teach, guide, and hold accountable. Those are two different things, and that’s also very different than not doing anything. I’m just going to let them figure it out.
FLYNN: Yes, which is interesting, because I must say, I tend to be figuring things out quite well, and sometimes when I let other people figure it out, it can go poorly, but I have held back and seen where it’s had success. So I like this idea of adaptability, the idea of moving out of a world of black and white and making sure your first step is letting them do it themselves. And you can watch a struggle, but if you see it going, I do think there’s a place sometimes that you should jump in.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
FLYNN: So I think maybe I have to lead with not trying to find the rules, but understanding that I’m going to have to grow as a leader and try things out, if that makes sense. I think the perfect gets in the way of the good, and I probably need to remember that. Does that make sense?
MURIEL WILKINS: It makes a ton of sense.
FLYNN: Because I didn’t do the expectations because I couldn’t figure out how to do them just the right way, and there’s a lot that got in the way of my own mind in setting these expectations, and in saying this to you now, I’m realizing that. So I can set them and maybe they won’t be perfect, but then I can adjust them. But the fact is not setting them is not an option because I’ve known I’ve had to do this for quite some time, but in trying to get the right ones, haven’t done them for everyone. I’ve only done them for the people I see errors occurring.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. And in looking for the, quote unquote, right one, you are setting up, there’s a rule. It’s either this or it’s that. There’s not. You are in a creative profession, so you know yourself. Yes, there are fundamentals. There’s foundational things I would assume, but then there’s a whole gradient of different ways of doing things, and it’s okay. But you’ve got to figure out what’s going to work for a particular client, a particular style, a particular whatever is happening. It’s the same with managing. So when you look at the situation, you look at the request, you look at the person, you can then say, “Okay, tried it this way, didn’t work. Let’s try a different way.” I think what’s important is that you stay clear around that expectations the outcomes you’re looking to drive to is ultimately what’s going to dictate how you manage the situation.
FLYNN: Yes, and also in keeping everyone happy all the time, which I have traditionally done, it’s been at the detriment of me and the company. So hitting a certain moment in my life has made me, and just saying, “I need to change everything,” has gotten me better at that. But it’s funny how it hits you like a brick wall when you’re suddenly… It’s like that moment that you’re like, “I’m just not putting up with anything anymore.”
MURIEL WILKINS: Right, right.
FLYNN: I don’t know. That’s what I’ve experienced.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Yeah. All right. So let me hear from you. I know we’ve talked through a lot of different things, but let me hear from you maybe your one big takeaway coming out of this conversation.
FLYNN: If you don’t mind, I’m going to give you the biggest and then the minor. Setting the expectations for each person, and then I have to stay consistent and do that with each team member, whether they’re having success or not, and the adaptability in all of the above. And then I think the other big thing is keeping what the company needs in the forefront of my mind. So if someone asks for permission for something, I really need to say, “What are our priorities? Does it meet that?” And not be the person that I tend to be where you like to say yes and keep it easy and keep things smoothly running along. That really does not have a place as a CEO or leader of a company. I just need to take that out of my vocabulary altogether. If they ask me something, I can say, “I will get back to you. I need to see if it serves the company.”
MURIEL WILKINS: And that is a unique role that you play as leading this company, right? That’s the voice. That’s where your voice shines, okay?
FLYNN: Yes, which I think I need to do more. I think that I have had an experience of the tail wagging the dog for a bit too long, and I am a gatekeeper and I need to stand proudly at the gate, which includes expectations. All of this is the same thing.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. So it’s sitting fully in your seat as the gatekeeper, the expectation setter.
FLYNN: Yes. And it needs to free me up so that I can figure out what’s next, because if I’m too busy in the trenches or finishing up, I can’t, I don’t have time to work on the company.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. Yeah. Okay? Okay. So you have a path forward or something that can help guide how you operate moving forward. Try those out. Try leading with that approach. It’s going to feel uncomfortable at times, that’s okay, and see how it plays out for you. And if it’s not working, then you adjust a little bit, and that’s okay. All right?
FLYNN: Okay. I do want to thank you because you taking this call had led me to do so much work to get here, that I’ve come a long way.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, what the beautiful thing about that is that I think what that shows is that you have a lot of the knowledge already, and maybe it’s taking that time to actually sit and think through it and reflect on it and process it out, and ask yourself the questions and write it out will let the answers emerge for you.
FLYNN: And taking that time. So you really need to set… You’re not here to do work every day. You need to set aside that time to really think it through.
MURIEL WILKINS: Well, that is the work. That is the work. That’s part of the work. See it as part of your job. That’s part of the gig, is doing exactly what you did to get prepared for this meeting.
FLYNN: Which yes, takes the time. More time thinking than anything else, which is interesting.
MURIEL WILKINS: So maybe that should be a practice as… something that you put as part of your repertoire. Maybe it’s one hour a week or something, that you just schedule it in as a meeting with yourself, or daily, you’re doing 20 minutes of just writing out your thoughts, you’re journaling about work.
FLYNN: Thank you for your time.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you.
FLYNN: Yeah, I just think slowing down. I’m a doer, so it’s hard to realize that in this case, as a leader, sometimes it’s the thinking stuff that’s more important than the doing stuff, and I think that’s a constant reminder.
MURIEL WILKINS: Beautiful. Beautiful. Awesome. Thank you.
FLYNN: Thank you.
MURIEL WILKINS: As the leader of an organization, especially one you started, there isn’t always a clear path to where to go next. You don’t have the same kind of structure that might be laid out in a traditional organization. Flynn came to the table looking for help in setting her team up for success. To get there, she needed to look beyond tactical skills and structures that she’d relied on in the past. Now, it was about scaling up her leadership and holding her team accountable by clearly communicating her expectations, creating systems, and challenging herself to stay consistent. To do that successfully will also mean a shift in perspective from one of, “I need to get things done and solve problems,” to, “I need to guide others to be able to solve problems themselves.” Part of what was holding Flynn back was a particular way of thinking about her organization and what she could and couldn’t do. By letting go of such limiting beliefs it opens up new opportunities for Flynn and her team, and now it comes down to her doing her work so that the organization can get to the next level.

Episode Unknown: How Leaders Can Spot What’s Really Holding Them Back
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: Hi friends. It’s Muriel Wilkins and welcome back. Hi friends. It’s Muriel Wilkins and welcome back to Coaching Real Leaders. Today’s episode is a little different. I’m sharing a conversation I had with two of my favorite people, Amy Gallo and Amy Bernstein, on one of my favorite podcasts, Harvard Business Review’s Women at Work.
The episode is called Let Go of The Beliefs That Limit How You Lead. I wanted to bring it here because so much of what we talk about on Coaching Real Leaders, the moments of self-doubt, the recurring challenges, the ways we hold ourselves back, often comes down to what we believe ourselves as.
And this chat with Amy centers around what I call hidden blockers. Seven core beliefs I’ve seen over and over in my coaching work that quietly keep even the most capable leaders from moving forward. Things like, “I don’t belong here,” or “I have to have all the answers,” or “I can’t slow down.” These aren’t just ideas. They’re the stories we live out every day at work, often without realizing it.
This conversation also gives you a sneak peek of my new book, Leadership Unblocked, which comes out on October 28th and is available for pre-order now. If you’ve ever wondered what’s getting in your way or what’s possible once you stop letting those old beliefs drive you, I think you’ll really connect with this episode. So with that, let’s jump into my discussion with the two Amys on Women at Work.
AMY GALLO: You’re listening to
Women at Work
from Harvard Business Review. I’m Amy Gallo.
AMY BERNSTEIN: And I’m Amy Bernstein. A regular guest of ours, executive coach Muriel Wilkins, is here with us yet again, yay, with her signature mix of candor and compassion.
MURIEL WILKINS: Hello. Thank you for having me here again.
AMY GALLO: Nice to have you back.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So great to see you.
AMY GALLO: Muriel, every time you’re on the show, you help us see what being a leader actually requires on the inside, and you’ve channeled that special gift into your latest book. Tell everyone what it’s called.
MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely. So, my latest book is called
Leadership Unblocked: Break Through the Beliefs That Limit Your Potential
.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So, I have to be honest, I identified with several of those beliefs, but the one I focused on is the belief called “I need it done now.”
AMY GALLO: And I identified with another of them, the “I know I’m right,” which I understand, Muriel, is one you have struggled with as well.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yes. Have struggled with, struggle with, and probably will always struggle with, but with a little bit more ease.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So, we’ll go into detail about those hidden blockers and the steps you had us go through, which we strongly recommend our listeners go through too.
AMY GALLO: Yeah. We went from vague feelings of we know we need to make a change, all the way to concretely listing what we need to start and stop doing.
AMY BERNSTEIN: Not only so that we as individuals can reach our full potential, but also so that our teams can and our organizations can as well.
AMY GALLO: All right, so Muriel, before Amy B and I tell you about the awareness we got from reading and reflecting—and it was a bit of painful awareness at times—can you just tell us what you mean by a “hidden blocker” and how would someone know that’s what they have?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. So, a hidden blocker is basically a belief. It lives on the inside of you, which is why it’s often hidden because you’re not even aware that it’s there. And a belief, for simplicity’s sake, is something that you think is true. We all have beliefs, and some of them are based on facts. Most of them are based on our perceptions—the lens through which we look at the world—which has quite frankly nothing to do with what’s happening at the moment but is a reflection of everything that has happened to us beforehand. So, the reason I call them hidden blockers is one, because we’re often not aware of them, so they are hidden until you can bring them to the surface. But second, they often block us from being able to reach the goals that we have for ourselves unwittingly because they are serving another purpose but not necessarily the purpose that you want to have, which is to reach whatever professional goals or personal goals that you have.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So, some of the signs that you describe of struggling with one or more of those blockers—they include low morale, stalled advancement, resentment—they sound like problems we blame on others. Why is it so hard to see that we might be the common thread?
MURIEL WILKINS: Think about it. When you have to blame yourself for something, what does it mean? It means that you have to do something about it. So, I think it’s very easy to look at others to blame for what might be happening. And in effect, it’s not say that others aren’t contributing to it, but what most of us don’t do is say,
How am I contributing to the issue that’s at hand or the challenge that I’m facing?
And when we can start looking at what our own contributions are, at the very least we can make some movement there; because once you start making movement, it will change the dynamic of the circumstance no matter what.
And in my role as an executive coach, which is what I’ve done for over 20 years now, my role is to help my clients or the individuals that I’m working with figure out how to be as successful as they can be within the context that they’re in. My role is not to change the context. And so as much as my clients hate it, at the end of the day, what I always tell them is, “you’re the one who’s sitting in front of me, so you’re the only one who I can work with in terms of making a difference. So, let’s talk about what choices you have in front of you for what you can do differently, keeping in mind again that everything is co-created.” So, the minute that one individual changes the way that they behave or respond, it automatically changes the dynamic.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So, my blocker, as I mentioned, is “I need it done now.” And I used to see that as one of my strengths—that you sent me an email, I responded almost immediately. Slack, even faster. And I hit this point of exhaustion not too long ago where I realized I cannot do that anymore. It was counterproductive, and it was burning me out. And so I realized that I was making this fundamental mistake, which was I was not separating the urgent from the important, and then relatedly, I was letting other people’s urgency be my urgency. And I realized from that, that I needed to first make the distinction between the urgent and the important and stick to it, not get blown with every puff of wind.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. This is a really common one, and I want to touch on a few things that you said, Amy. The first is you used to think of this as a strength of yours. Well, the fact of matter is it was perceived as a strength of yours when it served you well in the capacity that you were in, probably when you were an individual contributor, earlier on in your career. I remember when I came out of college, my first job, and for a long time afterwards, that is what got me great credibility with my bosses. The minute they said jump, I was like,
How high? Let’s go
. I was more urgent than they were. I was figuring out what was urgent for them and solving it before it became urgent for them.
But then this belief though is one of the ones that really holds people back from leading at scale. So one of the things that’s key here is recognizing, are the mantras or beliefs or principles that we live by at certain points of our career or in certain organizations… do they necessarily serve us well when the situation or the context or the goal has changed? And in your case, it does not to continue with the “I want it done now” across the board because you are now leading at a much bigger scale with a lot of people wanting you to do things urgently—but not necessarily the most important things.
AMY BERNSTEIN: Right. And just to your earlier point about how hard it is to realize that these are things that are built on beliefs rather than facts, my behavior was habit. There was no mantra. It was decades and decades of habit. And so understanding it took some work.
AMY GALLO: And also I am realizing so much of this is internal work, but you have to undo what others look to you for.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right. A lot of people benefit from our behaviors and
well, what is it going to mean now if Amy B is not responding to her all her emails within four hours? Oh my gosh
. And so, all it means is that there’s a dynamic that now needs to be renegotiated. And that’s what I talk about is if you can own your part of the dynamic, the minute you make a change, the dynamic changes. So let it start with you.
AMY BERNSTEIN: Yeah.
MURIEL WILKINS: So, Amy B, let me ask you a question. If you had to reframe from “I need it done now” to a different belief that you think would best serve you right now, what would that be for you?
AMY BERNSTEIN: Well, so what I do now is before I even open my inbox or look at my Slack, I start out thinking,
What do I need to get done today? What needs to happen so that everything else that needs to happen can happen?
So, setting priorities and sequencing my own activities. And then when I look at the inbox, I’m scanning for the white-hot stuff that I need to deal with. And the rest of it, I just leave it unread.
MURIEL WILKINS: I hear that reframe as moving from “I need it done now” to “I need to focus on what actually needs to get done today.”
AMY BERNSTEIN: Exactly.
MURIEL WILKINS: Which, there’s a small nuance there.
AMY BERNSTEIN: Well, it’s also me taking control and not being controlled by other people’s requests. It was just super-responsiveness.
MURIEL WILKINS: Look, this is a really common one, and I think to really unpack it, you have to understand what the source of it is. Because this, “I need to do it now” did not just start a couple of years ago. And for everybody it’s different. I know for myself that I need to do it now came from a place of, the more productive I was, the more accolades I got. And that’s nice to get accolades, and so why not keep getting those accolades? At the end of the day, it was a way of being valuable. And so I had a strong identity to productivity being where I pinned all of my value until it came too much of a cost.
AMY GALLO: Yeah. Well, the blocker I identify most with the, “I know I’m right.” The point of this chapter where you start talking about things that may have led you to have this hidden blocker. I was a little like,
Was she sitting in my therapy sessions?
Because you were praised a lot for having the right answer. You were often told that you were smart and publicly recognized for it. You excelled academically. I was just like,
oh my gosh, of course I ended up with this know-it-all blocker
. It makes so much sense, and yet you’re blind to it because it serves you so well until it doesn’t.
MURIEL WILKINS: Until it doesn’t.
AMY GALLO: That was the interesting thing about reading that chapter is that you don’t try to convince the client example… Philip is his name in the chapter. You don’t try to convince him that he doesn’t know it all. You’re just trying to convince him that his arrogance and impatience is standing in his way. So, it’s not that he doesn’t have the right answers. I’m saying [laughter] it’s not that I don’t have the right answers; it’s that the fact that I’m not including others in the decision. I think the real cost of the blocker is that I end up making other people feel small because I don’t leave room for them. My thoughts, my ideas, my confidence takes up so much room that it just hurts the connection to be honest.
MURIEL WILKINS: And Amy G, if your goal was solely around knowing the answer, then we’re good. Keep doing what you’re doing. Keep being the first person to give the answer. Keep having the answer. But if you are now defining your success as,
I want to make sure we get to the right answer, solving the problem is important, and I don’t want other people to experience being around me as being small or not included…if that is also part of my leadership, the way that I want others to experience my leadership
, then in a way that belief is not supporting that goal. So, it always comes back to, What’s your goal? What is it that you want as a leader, how do you want others to experience you and as well as how do you want to experience yourself?
AMY GALLO: Yeah. Can I tell a… I don’t think I’ve ever shared this on the podcast. But when I realized this was a problem, this hidden blocker for me was when I was working as a consultant, I had a colleague who had become a good friend, and we were working on a project. And at the end of a meeting, he looked at me, and I’ll change the curse word, but he said, “Do you know at the end of every sentence, there’s a silent ‘you idiot’ that you don’t say, but it’s in your tone?” And he said it. At the time we laughed about it,
ha ha
, and I’m mortified, but that moment of feedback was really harsh. And yet, such a… I mean, thank you to Rosario, who gave me that, who took the leap to say that, because I had no idea.
MURIEL WILKINS: And Amy G, I have a story to one up on you. I went through the exact same thing. I literally rolled my eyes at someone. To this day I can see it. I remember doing it, and I know what was going through my head was I
know the answer to this, and this person here doesn’t know what the heck they’re talking about
. And this was very early on in my career, and I remember—it was in consulting as well. And the partner pulled me to the side, and he was like, “Okay. You can’t do that.” And I was like, “Do what?”
AMY GALLO: You mean, have every answer all the time?
MURIEL WILKINS: And he said, “I know you knew the answer, but that wasn’t your job in that meeting. Your job was to let the client get to the answer. You were just there to be supportive and to answer questions if they had them.”
AMY GALLO: Amy B and I are pretty aware at this moment of what our hidden blockers are, although maybe we have more too. But if you had coached us five years, 10 years ago when we weren’t as dialed into this, how do you get people to develop the awareness that these exist and what their specific one is?
MURIEL WILKINS: So, I see my job as helping facilitate that thought process with the goal of that anyone who I work with—and that is my goal with the book as well—can do that for themselves, so that they can coach themselves. And I think the first place to start is to recognize when there’s some dissonance that is important enough to the individual for them to want to change. And that dissonance either needs to be with themselves, they’re feeling like
the way I’m behaving is not aligned with either who I want to be or who I believe I am
. That’s number one. Or there’s a dissonance between how they’re behaving and external.
So what that looks like a lot of times is the boss says, “This is unacceptable,” or the organization says, “This is unacceptable,” or everything that I’m using to externally measure my success, the promotion, company results, that presentation, the outcome is not aligned with what I want. And so it’s dissonance for most individuals that creates this sense of need for change. And I will say for a lot of my… Not even a lot—
all
of my clients. I always tell them it’s actually not about changing the belief. It’s having more range in your beliefs so that they are aligned with what it is that you want, which is where we start getting into… you know, the most mature leaders are the ones who can hold conflicting beliefs at one point. This is the
both-and
. They can hold different beliefs and operate with them because they have enough maturity and wisdom and discernment to be able to say,
Okay, yes, this is a time where I need to have the answer, and this is a time where that belief doesn’t serve me and I’m not going to do it
.
So, the first is usually when somebody asks me to work with them is because there’s a tension; it’s not because everything’s going well. And so you have to feel that tension that makes you wonder,
There’s something that’s not working as well as I would like it to
. Again, most people don’t think it’s them. They think it’s somewhere out there that something is not right. And then the second is to really get curious. What is happening right now in you that’s making you experience this in the way that you’re experiencing it? And what would you need to believe in order to be able to meet that goal that you now have?
And so it’s through a series of questions. There’s no way I could go to a client and just say, “You know what your hidden blocker is? It’s that you think you need it done now.” It’s more in that they’re seeing that something isn’t working. And I say, “Well, what do you want to have work?” They’re like, “Well, I want to feel like I’m being productive and I can make decisions.” “Okay. Well, what would you need to believe in order for that to happen?” And they’ll say, “I would need to believe that I don’t need to respond to all of my emails within four hours.” “Okay. So what would you need to believe?” “I need to believe that certain things are being taken care of and that I can delegate certain things and that there are certain things that are really urgent and that’s what I need to focus on.” And then we work down that thread: If you were to do that, what would look differently?
AMY GALLO: Well, I love the, “what would you need to believe?”
MURIEL WILKINS: Look, I’m not a therapist, I’m not a psychologist, and I give all credit to those who are. But at the end of the day, whether you’re at work or outside of work, we all have these fundamental human needs, which are, we need to feel like we’re safe, we need to feel like we’re connected and we belong, and we need to feel like we’re worthy and valued. The issue is that many times we try to force circumstances to make it happen, which is where these beliefs come from.
For me, the one around “I need it done now” or “I have the answer” came from a place of, I need to feel valued, and this is the best way I can show my value so I’m going to go for it. But part of what needs to happen as we lead is we need to evolve and grow, which to me is the biggest business case for leadership development. We need to grow to a place where we’re not looking for these external circumstances to feed that. Because as long as we’re looking for those external circumstances to feed that, we move into control. We try to control people, we try to control systems, we try to control… Which is very different than management and leadership. And it starts becoming very unproductive. And that’s where we start getting people like my clients that need help to move through those things because not only is it blocking them, but it’s blocking their teams and sometimes organizations.
AMY GALLO: Yeah. Let’s talk about other people’s blockers for a moment, because sometimes you notice someone else thinking about the “I need to be involved” chapter, and you list signs—like joining meetings you don’t need to be in, being resentful about your workload, insisting on being CC’d on things. Sometimes we see those behaviors in other people. Is there any way to help someone you work with see this as a blocker?
MURIEL WILKINS: Okay, so here’s the thing. Part of this is that we wait until the moment or the situation to figure out how do I now show people that they could be doing something differently? And this is to me where modeling leadership is important. If you have shown all along as a leader or as a colleague, that you are very self-aware and that you take that self-awareness seriously, that you do the work, believe me, people are watching. And you have much more permission and leeway to say, “Hey, you know what, colleague, can I share something with you about what I’ve experienced?” And you use yourself as the role model. So that to me is always the first place to start. The second place or the subsequent place, is you need to ask for permission from people to actually provide them with help, even if you’re a manager.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So how do you ask for permission?
MURIEL WILKINS: If you came and we’re having coffee, Amy B, or I walk into your office, and you’re like, “Oh my God, I’ve got 10,000 emails in my inbox.” And I would be like, “So do you mind if I give you some thoughts and some suggestions or that we talk through this right now?” And you have every right to say, “No. I don’t want to.” Most people will not turn it down. And then you move into, “Well, what’s going on? Why do you feel…” You try to figure out that dissonance. Do you want to feel something different? Is it that you want a different result? What is it that you want? And you’re like, “Oh my gosh, I can’t… These decisions.” “Okay. Well, here’s what I’m noticing. Can I give you a little bit of my observations?” I don’t even think you have to call it feedback. Feedback is so loaded. “Can I share with you my observations? I’m seeing you respond very quickly, and I’m just curious what’s driving that for you.”
AMY BERNSTEIN: So back to the person who always needs to be involved, has to be at the meeting, needs to be CC’d on the email. What if you said to them, “Why do you need to be at the meeting?” What if you interrogated it with an open mind? Would that be helpful? Would that help move them?
MURIEL WILKINS: Look, I think that it really depends on your relationship with that individual. If there is high trust, you’ve had these types of conversations, this person is used to you kicking the tire on them, no problem. That question with all those conditions not there can also lead to some defensiveness and them shutting down and actually defending the hidden blocker, which is why I think it’s very important to add context. Why are you asking that question? And that’s when it is,” look, I noticed that you’re in these meetings and I know you’re also really busy, do you mind if I just share my observations or ask you a couple of questions around that?”
AMY BERNSTEIN: That makes sense.
MURIEL WILKINS: Yep. I want you to. Okay. And I don’t even think it’s “Why?” It’s, “What is it that’s making you have to come to these meetings?” And the minute they start… they usually will blame it on other people. Okay, “I have to be there.” “Oh, okay. Well, what would happen if you weren’t? Oh, and is that causing any difficulty for you?” Again, let’s remember if it’s not causing dissonance for the individual or causing any type of tension or difficulty, they’re not going to be open to any type of input that you have on this. And if we think that we can actually influence them and get them to change the belief or whatnot without them wanting to, that’s a form of our own control. So, this is not about manipulating and controlling others. It is about them being able to get out of their own way. But they have to get out of their own way, and you’re just there to facilitate it if they’d like.
AMY GALLO: Amy B, how have you pointed out to other leaders when you’ve noticed they might have a hidden blocker?
AMY BERNSTEIN: Well, I didn’t have that language and that structure in my head when I’ve done it in the past, I only just read Muriel’s book. But what I have done is when someone I’m close to has complained about something: “I’m always so busy; I don’t have time to catch my breath.” And the same person also needs to be included in every conversation, in every meeting, on every email thread, I’ve asked, “Why do you really need to be in that? Your deputy is handling it. Do you not trust her to make a good decision? Are you worried that you’re going to miss something important? Are there other ways that you can catch up?”
I’ve also pointed out how complicating it is to demand that this person need to be included in everything. Every additional person you add to a meeting makes that meeting that much more complicated to schedule, for example. And very little gets decided in meetings with 15 people in them. You know what I mean? So I try to point out that there are behaviors that this person can control that are both causing the pain and by modifying them could alleviate some of the pain.
MURIEL WILKINS: And I think what’s critical here is people can modify behaviors, but if they don’t modify the thing that’s driving the behavior, it’s short-lived is the issue. And I think that that’s what I realized after years of coaching: I could coach on new skills, and I could provide new actions and new strategies and approaches, but it wasn’t sustainable because the operating system that supports those new actions and those new skills—which are the beliefs—weren’t in place. And so, they would then revert back to the old behavior quite quickly.
AMY BERNSTEIN: So, I want to get your help on something, Muriel. I want a free session. [Laughter] It’s not about me personally, although it causes me a lot of pain. It’s really about the organization and our love of meetings, our reliance on them, our over-reliance on them to conduct any business. Meetings that are not always all that productive, meetings that are a huge drain on individual’s time. And I’m wondering if you can help us understand what hidden blockers may be at play here.
MURIEL WILKINS: I think the place to start is to say,
Okay. If we feel pain from the way it is now, what would make it feel like it has less pain? What would that look like?
Okay. So, is it that we have less meetings? Is it that less people are at meetings? So it’s the envisioning the future. And then you have to ask yourself,
What would we need to actually believe in order to make that happen?
To have less meetings, let’s say, or for not everyone to be in the meeting. And what I have found in this particular situation is you’ll hear things like, “Oh, we would need to trust that the people who are in the room will actually make the right decision.” And that starts hitting the nerve.
AMY BERNSTEIN: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: Right. Because then it’s like, “Okay. So, what is your capability of believing that now?” “I don’t know how comfortable I am with that.” “Well, what makes you uncomfortable?” “Because I don’t believe that I can trust everyone.” Now we got it. Okay. So now we understand what we need to work on is the trust factor. And I’m just using that as an example. I don’t know if that’s exactly what’s happening in your situation. But I think it is about envisioning what is the new goal, what would need to be the mindset that we would need to have collectively in order for that new goal to happen? And if we don’t feel confident we can have that mindset, why is that? Get curious about it, to understand what’s the mindset that we have currently that’s keeping us from being there and unpacking that. And then making a decision around do we want to have a different mindset or not and what actions would support it. So, it’s no different than the work you have to do at an individual level. You’re just doing it at a collective level.
What I find a lot of times is with teams or organizations, when there is either disagreement or behavior in the organization that’s misaligned with what people want or what they say they want is that a lot of times there’s not alignment around the assumptions that individuals are making. So, even from a meeting standpoint, if there’s misalignment around what the purpose of the meetings are, that in itself is a belief. If I believe the meetings are to make decisions, but my colleagues think that the meetings are for us to get consensus, that creates a different need for the meetings. So, it is unpacking,
What is leading to today us having a lot of meetings in this culture, to what would we need to understand, what assumptions would we need to make in order to support what we envision, which is less meetings or shorter meetings or meetings with less people in it
.
AMY BERNSTEIN: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
MURIEL WILKINS: But what you can’t do is—well, you can do it; I’m just saying I don’t think it will lead to long-term success, I think it will lead to long-term frustration—is all of a sudden say,
We’re changing the meeting structure, and we’re moving from our weekly meeting where everybody’s involved to now we’re going to move to monthly and only these three people come
. You can do that. But if you do that, you have to provide what are the underlying assumptions that are shifting to then warrant this new structure. That’s where people miss out. They not only announce the change; they don’t give context for it. And as part of that context, they don’t provide, what are the assumptions that are moving to align with this change?
AMY GALLO: That resonates so much having been part of organizations that are trying to make shifts, but they don’t address the underlying beliefs. You addressed the meeting issue, but is there any other advice you have about pushing back on some of those blockers or helping the organization make a shift when it’s a group shared belief?
MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah. Look, I think it starts with leadership. If you really want to see a shift from an organizational standpoint, you better work with the leaders first and ensure that they are aligned with what needs to change—not just in terms of actions, but they are also aligned in terms of mindset and assumptions. And then how do they do the work with everyone else? I have an organization that I’ve worked with, and they say, “Oh yes, we believe in work-life balance.” But when you look at the leadership, they’re in there every Saturday, every Sunday, all day. And so—
AMY GALLO: And sending emails at 11:30 at night.
MURIEL WILKINS: At 11:30. So the mindset is not aligned with the values that they espouse, and everybody sees right through it. Something fundamental underneath this is that a leader cannot move an organization to a capacity level that they haven’t reached. So, if a leader is trying to shift an organization to behave in a particular way, and yet they have not been able to move themselves to that behavior or evolve their own mindset, there’s no way they’re going to be able to lead others to it.
AMY GALLO: Muriel, as always, this has been so helpful, and I feel like a better person as a result. So, thank you so much.
MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you.
AMY BERNSTEIN: And Muriel, thank you for helping me think constructively about some stuff that’s really been eating at me.
MURIEL WILKINS: It’s always such a pleasure to speak with both of you, and thank you for having me and being deep in this conversation with me. It’s truly an honor.
I hope you enjoyed that conversation with Amy Gallo and Amy Bernstein from Women at Work as much as I did. I wanted to share it here because what we talked about, those beliefs that quietly shape how we lead, is the same kind of work we do on Coaching Real Leaders. It’s about looking beneath the surface of performance and strategy to the mindset that drives it all.
If what you heard resonated, that’s just a glimpse of what I go deeper into in my new book, Leadership Unblocked. In it, I unpack the seven core beliefs that I’ve seen most often hold leaders back, and share a path for freeing yourself from them so you can lead with more impact and ease.
Leadership Unblocked comes out October 28th and it’s available now for pre-order wherever you get your books. You’ll find a pre-order link in the show notes and a special invitation to join me for a book club discussion.
As always, thank you for listening and for doing the work. I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders. Be well.


================================================================================
Episode Unknown: Coming Soon: Season 9 of Coaching Real Leaders
Year: 2025
================================================================================

MURIEL WILKINS: As you go through your career, a lot changes. You get new titles, you join different organizations, you take on more responsibilities. But one thing is constant: there will always be challenges. That’s where I come in.
SPEAKER 1: I’ve only been here for a short time compared to those around me. I’m trying to figure out how I can be seen more as a leader for the work that I’m putting in and showing up to do.
SPEAKER 2: I’m a little exhausted. I felt like I was firing all cylinders and I had these great superpowers and getting great recognition. And I don’t feel like I have those superpowers anymore. I’m wondering if…This is a horrible thing to say, but am I past my peak?
SPEAKER 3: I come across as very youthful a lot of times, and that can be mistaken for just being real informal sometimes, and that I do know about myself. And then I fight it sometimes because I know that executive presence is really… For me, the way I’ve interpreted is it’s a reflection of who you are in front of people.
