Episode 1: How Do I Address Feedback on Increasing My Visibility?

Muriel Wilkins:
I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is Coaching Real Leaders, part of the HBR podcast network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them, so that hopefully they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Jada to protect her confidentiality. She’s experienced positive career momentum in the past, frequently getting promotions and advancing through the ranks.
Jada:
I really learned out of that that I love people. My soft skills seem to be something that gets me into places and rooms. I was promoted pretty often and quickly in the beginning of those stages and got to learn even more about what I was good at, what I wasn’t good at, what I liked, what I didn’t like.
Muriel Wilkins:
While she was proud of her achievements, Jada also recognized that there were things about the industry she started her career in that she didn’t like as much, that weren’t really aligned with her values, and so she transitioned to the tech sector, where she could focus on strategy and big picture planning, among other things. But making that switch also came with some downsides.
Jada:
I knew that changing industries would potentially involve moving backwards to move forward. So, that has happened, and I was okay with that. I was a little disappointed that the growth that I saw previously in my old industry hasn’t been happening as quickly as it has been in this one, but generally, I’m loving the work. I find it extremely challenging. I love a challenge. I’m getting to a place now where it’s feeling a little less challenging and more comfortable, and I would like to get back into a space where I’m on my toes.
Muriel Wilkins:
Jada’s hoping to get back on the promotion track and managing teams. In order to do that, I started by asking a bit more about the slower career growth she’s experiencing and what she thinks might be behind it.
Jada:
I’ve asked for feedback about this from direct managers, from managers in other parts of the company who still see my work. And from my immediate managers, I get told that I need to work on my visibility. It’s really shocked me because we had a change in leadership, and I went to my new manager and asked them for some feedback on what I could be doing to grow, and they said visibility also. And I was like, “Wow, this is really interesting.” Because the old manager and the new manager never spoke to each other. I don’t think they had any notes they compared about me.
And what I couldn’t help thinking about was in my previous industry, the feedback that I often got there was around executive presence. Back then, I attributed the executive presence with being young, looking young, but now in my new industry, I’m usually one of the older people in the room. And it’s just really interesting to have seen across two different spaces how I’ve gotten feedback that’s related more to other people’s perception of me and not really about my performance and work.

MURIEL WILKINS: I’m Muriel Wilkins, and this is
Coaching Real Leaders
, part of the HBR Podcast Network. I’m a longtime executive coach who works with highly successful leaders who’ve hit a bump in the road. My job is to help them get over that bump by clarifying their goals and figuring out a way to reach them so that, hopefully, they can lead with a little more ease. I typically work with clients over the course of several months, but on this show, we have a one-time coaching meeting focusing on a specific leadership challenge they’re facing. Today’s guest is someone we’ll call Margaret to protect her confidentiality. She’s an executive who’s held leadership positions for over a decade at a few different companies.
MARGARET: It is highly rewarding, it’s high visibility, it’s high impact, it’s high stress, and it requires always-on. But I really love what I do. Even when I sometimes don’t love the job, I really love the people problem-solving aspect. How do I coach people? How do I upskill them? How do I help form context? I’m aware that some of my superpowers in this role are, I’m very good at giving context, I’m very good at connecting dots for people, and I am a nerd at heart, and I love the hands-on, and I love the problem-solving.
MURIEL WILKINS: After some time at her previous organization, Margaret decided to look for a new executive position. And then she decided to take a chance and take an opportunity abroad.
MARGARET: I took it for a number of reasons. One is, it was an overseas opportunity, which was very interesting, and we’ve traveled a lot, and now we have the opportunity to travel more. We have a nice window of opportunity where kids are in good shape. They don’t need us for a little while. Parents are in good shape. Let’s just take the opportunity while we have it. And I really like the company’s mission and vision. It’s just one of those things that just really aligned.
MURIEL WILKINS: But the new role has not been without its challenges.
MARGARET: I came in, and immediately, there was a crisis. So I wound up diving in and getting very tactical and operational to help get through that crisis. Just as I was hitting a point of, “Okay, I think we’ve got everything under control. I can pull back up and really start focusing on strategy,” we had another crisis hit. My boss had to leave unexpectedly. Suddenly, I get thrown into his position. As it turns out, we also were in a situation where we were needing to cut costs. I did a big reorg. At one point, for almost the entire year last year, I had 20 direct reports, which is not tenable at all, and I wasn’t able to give them the attention that they needed. I just didn’t have the bandwidth and the capacity. And so I felt very bad about not being able to be the leader I needed to be for those folks.
MURIEL WILKINS: Margaret, like many executives, is someone who’s been in leadership roles for many years, but it still isn’t smooth sailing. She’s feeling bogged down in the tactical and managing the unexpected crises and having a hard time focusing on where she really wants to take her work and her team next. Let’s start the conversation as I ask her about where she is today, where she wants to go, and what she thinks might be standing in her way.
MARGARET: I’m now in a position where the crises are handled. I’ve got the right leadership team. What I really need to do now is what I should have done two years ago, which is, I need to build out the three to five-year strategy. I need to make sure that everybody understands what the really, really important things are, and I’m stuck. I feel like I’m still stuck in the operational pieces. I feel like I can’t really truly pull myself out of it because I can still see things happening. I’m a little exhausted. Also, I’ve sort of hit a point of, the previous two jobs, I felt like I was firing all cylinders and I had these great superpowers and getting great recognition, and I don’t feel like I have those superpowers anymore. I’m wondering if, this is a horrible thing to say, but am I past my peak? Did I expend all my superpowers? Am I just done?
But I really feel like I have writer’s block. I know what needs to be done. I really do. And doing this for a long time, I’m well-educated and well-experienced. I know I need to get this written down. I know I need a communication plan. But when I say I’m working on the plan, I’ve literally been working on it for six months. But largely, I’m just procrastinating. I want to build a plan, but there are a couple of reasons that I’m feeling stuck. One is the thing I said before, which is, there were these crises and I wound up getting sucked down in the tactical, and I’m finding it very, very hard to come back up.
MURIEL WILKINS: You faced a number of crises when you first joined the company. The role was not a role that you weren’t unfamiliar with, right?
MARGARET: Right.
MURIEL WILKINS: It sort of leveraged things that you had done in the past.
MARGARET: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: But you faced those crises. Those crises resulted in you having to get very tactical-
MARGARET: Yep.
MURIEL WILKINS: … down in the weeds. You were able to up-level your team and get past the crises. And now, you’re at a place of trying to do the longer term, thinking three to five years out, something, again, that you’re not unfamiliar with. But you’re finding yourself stuck, blocked, procrastinating from moving forward and doing it.
MARGARET: Yes.
MURIEL WILKINS: That’s right? Okay. Got you. Before we jump into what you believe is keeping you blocked, what does that feel like to you to feel blocked? How do you know that you are stuck?
MARGARET: I have Post-it notes all over the place with themes of things that I need to go on that three to five-year roadmap, and I can’t visualize how to put them together. I have action items on my to-do list that go undone for longer than they should, just because I look at them and go, “Mm, I don’t know if that’s important enough.” I’m having trouble prioritizing. I have a little focus issue, but I don’t actually think it’s a focus issue. That part, I can’t pinpoint. I’ve never really had problems focusing. Although I will say my calendar is full every single day, so getting any focus time to actually sit down and brainstorm and visualize and think only comes on the weekends. And by the time the weekend comes, all I really want to do is sleep. It’s like I’m exhausted.
